But soon their clothing will be available for men too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The news first came out through an Instagram post on the brand's page to both reveal and tease the impending men's line for Fall 2018.&nbsp;The line will include&nbsp;suits, knitwear, coats, jeans, T-shirts, footwear, and accessories tailored specifically for men. The Row's menswear is said to contain classic refinement with minimalistic New York style from the 1980s and '90s.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>BURBERRY'S LATEST SNEAKERS OFFER&nbsp;1970S&nbsp;STYLE IN MODERN FASHION</a></strong></p><p>Surprisingly, this isn't the first time that the Olsens and The Row have dabbled in menswear before. Back in 2009, there was a small collection of men's clothing that seemed to be almost identical to their women's line. Then in 2016, they launched another line of men's clothing, but it didn't make much of an impact.&nbsp;Those two instances could be seen as trial runs for this impending launch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Olsen twins have spent the last two years making the best menswear for The Row. This included doing research on menswear, test-wearing by other designers, and doing trial runs on factories to make the best clothing. They even went as far as putting factories against each another to find the one that produced the best clothing for their upcoming line. In addition to this, multiple countries are involved in producing the clothing. While a majority of it comes from Japan, certain items are made in France, Italy, and the United States in order to make the best products.</p><p>The menswear will be made available sometime in October at The Row's&nbsp;two retail locations in both New York City and Los Angeles.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>JORDAN&nbsp;BRAND IS COLLABORATING&nbsp;SOCCER CLUB FOR FASHION LINE</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8yaqbJlm5bBpnnArJ%2BlnalivK2%2FxKdkq6enYrqmutJmnZqrmJ68r3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./norm-macdonalds-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Norm MacDonalds Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</span></a>
