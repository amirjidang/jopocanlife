A source close to the singer, 27, tells Us Weekly that Perry is “devastated” after learning on Thursday about the death of the Sons of Anarchy actor, whom she dated from 2005-2006.

A lot of her songs were partially inspired by him. I know ‘The One That Got Away’ and ‘Circle the Drain’ are partly about him, as well as<strong> Travis [McCoy</strong> of Gym Class Heroes]. But she was young and it was a time in her life she cherishes.” (Perry became a worldwide pop star in 2008 with her smash, “I Kissed a Girl,” and married <strong>Russell Brand</strong> in 2010. They finalized their divorce earlier this year.)</p><p>Adds the source, “They had good times. It’s really sad. She could never help him and couldn’t [let herself] go in that direction.”</p><p>On Wednesday, the body of 28-year-old Lewis was <a href=# rel=noopener>discovered in a driveway after the troubled actor fell or jumped</a> from a rooftop following a fight with his landlady,<strong> Catherine Davis</strong>.
