However, there are times when his personality shines and resonates with people — like <a href=#>Reeves choosing to travel light without security</a>. Keanu Reeves's relationship with visual artist Alexandra Grant is another part of his life that he doesn't share details about.</p><p>Keanu Reeves and the accomplished artist met in 2011 when they worked on a picture book, Ode to Happiness — Reeves wrote, Grant illustrated — together. The two remained acquaintances, then good friends over the years, but in November 2019, they announced they were dating. Reeves and Grant are usually seen smiling and holding hands at all red carpet events, but that's about all the public gets to see.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a rare surreal moment, Keanu Reeves described being with his girlfriend Alexandra Grant in bed as bliss. The moment, though awkward, was sweet — Grant also calls the actor an inspiration who makes her happy. Here's what happened during Keanu's awkward interview, what Alexandra has said about Keanu, and how this relationship is different from Reeves' past romances.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>8:03</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lhojwasn9js-hd.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Need More Proof That Keanu Reeves Is Literally The Best Person Ever?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Keanu Reeves is known for being the internet's boyfriend, but this is further proof he's literally the best person in the world.</span><h2 id=keanu-reeves-39-s-moment-of-bliss-is-with-his-girlfriend-alexandra-grant>Keanu Reeves's Moment Of Bliss Is With His Girlfriend, Alexandra Grant</h2><h3 id=keanu-reeves-gave-a-sweet-reply-when-asked-about-his-last-moment-of-bliss>Keanu Reeves gave a sweet reply when asked about his last moment of bliss</h3><p>It was surely a rare reveal by John Wick star Keanu Reeves when he talked about his girlfriend Alexandra Grant. The longtime couple is not usually keen on drawing attention to themselves, but this hint from Keanu Reeves proves they are still very much in love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar45529480.jpg><p>Speaking with PEOPLE magazine, <a href=#>Keanu Reeves revealed a moment of bliss he shared with his girlfriend Alexandra Grant</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Last moment of bliss? Meaning, if it was fleeting, you just thought, 'Right now, everything was perfect,'" the interviewer asked.</p><p>"A couple of days ago with my honey," Keanu said unbashedly.</p><p>"Where were you?"</p><p>"We were in bed," Keanu Reeves smiled. "We were connected. It was really nice. We were smiling and laughing and giggling and feeling great. It was really nice to be together."</p><p>This moment was endearing because Keanu Reeves rarely talks about his relationship with Alexandra Grant. While they have been friends for a long time before officially dating in 2019, the couple do not share personal details. Nonetheless, they show support and often provide fan-service PDAs in public.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/keanu-reeves-and-alexandra-grant-looking-extremely-happy.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Besides the rare moment, Reeves is also protective of his girlfriend, <a href=#>like when the Constantine star protected his girlfriend from a relentless stalker</a>. Keanu Reeves had to take drastic measures, including hiring top-notch security, investigating the stalker, and working with the LAPD to catch the notorious talker.</p><p>Keanu Reeves also filed a temporary restraining order and a civil harassment restraining order before the temporary order expired a month later.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/keanu-reeves-received-praise-for-his-rumored-no-touching-policy-with-female-fans-at-meet-and-greets-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Keanu Reeves Received Praise For His Policy With Female Fans At Meet And Greets</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>There are many theories as to why Keanu Reeves doesn't touch his female fans when posing for pictures.</span><h2 id=alexandra-grant-feels-inspired-in-her-relationship-with-keanu-reeves>Alexandra Grant Feels Inspired In Her Relationship With Keanu Reeves</h2><h3 id=alexandra-grant-has-opened-up-to-the-media-about-her-relationship-with-keanu-reeves>Alexandra Grant has opened up to the media about her relationship with Keanu Reeves</h3><p>When news of the couple dating exploded in 2019, <a href=#>Alexandra Grant told Vogue she wasn’t prepared for people’s reactions</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/keanu-reeves-and-girlfriend-alexandra-grant.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I think every single person I knew called me in the first week of November, and that’s fascinating," she said. "But the question I’ve been asking in all of this is, 'What is the opportunity for good?'"</p><p>On what people thought about their relationship because she was not the "typical woman" movie stars would go for, Grant said: "You know, the idea of fitting in… If I wanted to look like Kim Kardashian, I would have to have surgery removing about a foot off my legs."</p><p>However, the couple dating after being longtime friends seemed perfect for the artist.</p><p>Years later, Grant still feels the same towards the action actor. <a href=#>Alexandra Grant told PEOPLE that Keanu Reeves was an inspiration to her</a>. She said: "The good news about falling in love as an adult is that I had built my own career by the time that my relationship had begun. I feel very confident in the relationship on the red carpet. I feel confident on it alone."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's interdependent and independent in the best ways," she adds.</p><p>"What I love about Keanu and our exchange is that we're pushing each other to build new roads," she revealed. "Seeing the other person's problem-solving is inspiring, like, 'Oh, well, okay, this one, that's a cul-de-sac. How do I try this other thing?'"</p><p>"He's such an inspiration to me. He's so creative, he's so kind. He works so hard."</p><p>Grant also recalled people telling her her work had changed and become happier; "We're all human beings. We're animals. We're expressing from where we are and certainly feeling happier. I think the work is happier."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/does-keanu-reeves-girlfriend-alexandra-grant-work-a-9-to-5_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Does Keanu Reeves' Girlfriend Alexandra Grant Work A 9 To 5?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Keanu Reeves' fans are fascinated by his girlfriend Alexandra Grant and want to know what she does for a living.</span><h2 id=keanu-reeves-has-been-linked-to-many-celebrities-but-never-confirmed-the-relationships>Keanu Reeves Has Been Linked To Many Celebrities But Never Confirmed The Relationships</h2><h3 id=sandra-bullock-winona-ryder-diane-keaton-and-charlize-theron-are-rumored-exes-of-reeves-39>Sandra Bullock, Winona Ryder, Diane Keaton and Charlize Theron are rumored exes of Reeves'</h3><p>Keanu Reeves lives a private life.
