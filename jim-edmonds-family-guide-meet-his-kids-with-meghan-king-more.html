The pair welcomed two children together before calling it quits. Edmonds was later married to <a href=#><strong>Allison Jayne Raski</strong></a>, with whom he shares a son and a daughter, from 2008 to 2014 before tying the knot with <a href=#><strong>Meghan King</strong></a> in 2015.</p><p>Edmonds and the <a href=#>Real Housewives of Orange County</a> alum welcomed daughter Aspen in November 2016, followed by twin sons Hayes and Hart two years later. The pair <a href=#>split in October 2019</a>, and King revealed the following year that Hart was <a href=#>diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy</a>.</p><p>“Even though he’s the same kid, I expected it to hit me hard. But it didn’t. It didn’t hit me hard at all. In fact, I felt relieved,” the Bravo personality wrote in a blog post at the time, adding that part of her was “expecting” the particular diagnosis her son received. “This is the once dreadful diagnosis I knew was coming since that fateful day I googled the right thing and it hit me like a truck: CP. I knew it was CP since Hart was a few months old. I just knew.”</p><p>The “Intimate Knowledge” podcast host previously told fans Hart “has minor Periventricular Leukomalacia on both sides of his brain,” which <a href=#>can lead to “irreversible brain damage.”</a> She wrote in a June 2019 blog that <a href=#>she didn’t feel “punished”</a> for having a child with special needs, adding, “I do not see his diagnosis as anything but a gift: we were chosen to take on this special person.”</p><p><a href=#>Us Weekly broke the news</a> in May 2021 that King and Edmonds finalized their divorce. One year later, the sports broadcaster alleged that his ex-wife was <a href=#>wrong about Hart’s health</a>. After the reality TV alum shared an Instagram video about the toddler’s potty training struggles due to Cerebral Palsy, Edmonds claimed his child doesn’t have the congenital disorder.</p><p>“Jim wishes Meghan would respect their children’s privacy and stop putting their son and his challenges in the spotlight,” a rep for the California native told TMZ in July 2022.</p><p>Since splitting from King, the center fielder moved on with fiancée <a href=#><strong>Kortnie O’Connor</strong></a>. The Missouri native, for her part, was briefly married to President <a href=#><strong>Joe Biden</strong></a>‘s nephew <a href=#><strong>Cuffe Owens</strong></a> and has been candid about <a href=#>coparenting with Edmonds</a> following their divorce.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We have [a worse] relationship than we did when we split up,” she claimed on the “Divorced Not Dead” podcast in July 2022. “It’s horrible. It’s so detrimental for the kids [and] for us as individuals. … I would love to be able to communicate amicably. I would love to sit at a parent-teacher conference and sit with him and chat about our kids.”</p><p>Scroll down for a look at Edmonds’ big brood:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkt6q5jJ6bpqeemcBussCmoKWxXZzCqrDEZqSenaRitaq%2FjKSgnatdrLa1tIymnKCgkaN6rLXNoGSmp6KafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeff-wells-pastor-bio-wiki-age-height-wife-woodsedge-community-church-sermons-ministry-net-worth-facts-and-measurements.html><span>←</span><span>Jeff Wells (Pastor) Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Wife, WoodsEdge Community Church, Sermons, Ministry, Net</span></a>
