One person might be very attractive in your view, while the same person could be very unattractive to the next person. However, regardless of how personal the issue of attractiveness is, there are people we can all agree fall a bit below a certain standard of attractiveness - the kind that would never have a chance of landing an advertisement for even the lowest of beauty products. Then there are other people who are so attractive that they turn heads and cause people to bump into each other along the streets, just because of how amazing they look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Celebrities have it tough in this area because everyone expects them to have flawless beauty, and yet inside they are just normal human beings trying to make a living like you and I. These high expectations from their fans have forced celebrities to spend&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;money on cosmetic surgeries and procedures, all in a bid to hide their flaws. Therefore, when a celebrity appears to be less than perfect, we will always term them as unattractive - a rather unfair assessment, but it's one of the challenges they have to deal with for being who they are.</p><p>This&nbsp;is a list of ten of the most famous boy band members in history, who are here just because the public has at one time or another considered them to be less than perfect. Here are the top 10 most unattractive boy band members, who are obviously very attractive to someone else. Who do you think does not deserve to be on this list?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-wanya-morris-boys-ii-men><strong>10. Wanya Morris (Boys II Men)</strong></h2><p>Boys II Men is arguably the best and the biggest name when it comes to a cappella and R&B, owing to their beautifully written emotional music and their harmonies. The original four members of this band - Michael McCary, Nathan Morris, Wanya Morris and Shawn Stockman - came together in 1985 and through Motown Records the band was able to achieve international&nbsp;recognition.</p><p>However, due to health challenges, Michael McCary left the group in 2003, and the band continued on as a trio. The three remaining members not only sing and perform well but they also look amazing as they continue growing older ever more gracefully. Having to pick out the least attractive member of the band is no easy task, but some circles believe that Wanya Morris is the one.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-justin-jeffre-98-degrees><strong>9. Justin Jeffre (98 Degrees)</strong></h2><p>98 Degrees is a boy band made up of four exceptionally talented vocalists from Ohio; namely Jeff Timmons, Justin Jeffre, and Brothers Nick and Drew Lachey. This boy band came together without the influence of producers and record labels, but it was later signed by Motown, then Universal, and now Entertainment one.</p><p>Over their history, 8 amazing songs from the band have achieved the top 40 singles charts in the US, and they have&nbsp;sold over 10 million records the world over. Justin Paul Jeffre is known to have pursued political interests when the group was on a 13-year hiatus, but his attempts to become the mayor of Cincinnati did not give him the seat. Justin is possibly on this list because people do not necessarily like politicians, but do you think he is the least attractive member of the group?</p><p></p><h2 id=8-jay-mcguiness-the-wanted><strong>8. Jay McGuiness (The Wanted)</strong></h2><p>Max George, Jay McGuiness, Siva Kaneswaran, Nathan Sykes and Tom Parker are popularly known as The Wanted - one of Europe's leading boy bands. The above members came together to form the band in 2009, and since then they have performed not only in Europe but in different countries around the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The band has had a number of their songs topping the charts in Europe, and it has had considerable success over the years. When you look at the members of The Wanted you will notice that Jay McGuiness usually stands out, and not for the best of reasons. Although Jay is a very talented singer and an even better dancer, his looks fall a bit short of what you would expect.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-kevin-jonas-jonas-brothers><strong>7. Kevin Jonas (Jonas Brothers)</strong></h2><p>The Jonas Brothers are a very popular rock boy band made up of three brothers; Paul Kevin Jonas II, Joseph Adam Jonas, and Nicholas Jerry Jonas, which was very active between 2005 and 2013. Their appearances in the Disney Channel TV network contributed to how popular they became at the height of the band's career, but their music and TV shows have kept them popular to this day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This band won the Best New Artist award at the 51st Grammy Awards&nbsp;and has sold over 17 million records so far. With regard to the level of attractiveness of the individual members, it is hard to decide who the least attractive is because they all look the same. However, with serious rigorous analysis and survey of public opinion, <a href=#>Kevin Jonas</a> would have to take this slot.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-jacob-underwood-o-town><strong>6. Jacob Underwood (O-Town)</strong></h2><p>If you love bands, then you definitely watch Making The Band&nbsp;- a reality TV series produced by MTV. The first band here was O-Town in 2000, and it made it out of the show to become a wonderful band out in the music scene.</p><p>The members of this group are Trevor Penick, Erik-Michael Estrada, Dan Miller and Jacob Underwood, although Ashley Parker Angel was also part of the band in the beginning but turned down the offer to reunite after a 10-year hiatus. Although the members of the band are as good looking as you would expect from a boy band, Jacob Underwood will at times stand out in a not so attractive way.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-ricky-bell-bell-biv-devoe><strong>5.&nbsp;Ricky Bell (Bell Biv DeVoe)</strong></h2><p>Bell Biv DeVoe is the name of a boy band, a name that sounds unique and foreign. Those who are not very familiar with the band would be surprised to learn that the name of this band is just a combination of the last names of the band members, whose names are Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, and Ronnie DeVoe.</p><p>These three band members are formerly members of New Edition, but they branched out to form their own band in 1989, following the suggestion of producers Terry Lewis and Jimmy Jam. Of the three band members, a section of fans tend to think that Ricky Bell is the least attractive. Do you agree with them?</p><p></p><h2 id=4-a-j-mclean-backstreet-boys><strong>4. A. J. McLean (Backstreet Boys)</strong></h2><p>The Backstreet Boys were and still are one of the leading boy bands on the planet. This group of five amazing vocalists - namely <a href=#>AJ McLean</a>, <a href=#>Nick Carter</a>, <a href=#>Howie Dorough</a>, <a href=#>Brian Littrell</a> and <a href=#>Kevin Richardson</a> - was formed in 1993, in Orlando, Florida, and is still in existence to this day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Backstreet Boys are the best selling boy band in history, having sold over 130 million records worldwide and being the only boy band in history to have their first nine albums reaching the top ten positions on the Billboard 200 charts. With regard to just how attractive the band members are, many people claim that AJ is not as attractive as the others are, which is why&nbsp;he&nbsp;is on this list.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-isaac-hanson-hanson><strong>3. Isaac Hanson (Hanson)</strong></h2><p>Hanson are a rock band trio made up of three brothers; Isaac, Taylor and Zac. This band has been on the music scene since 1992, and it continues to entertain crowds and rock fans all over the world to this day. Their 1997 hit song "MMBop" propelled them to international recognition - an amazing song that was nominated three times at the Grammy awards.</p><p>Since the band is made up of three brothers, the three resemble each other a lot, but it seems as if the older brother Isaac lacks the attractiveness that runs in the family. For the longest time Isaac has been the least attractive member of the band, but do you think it is the same case today?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-danny-wood-new-kids-on-the-block><strong>2. Danny Wood (New Kids on the Block)</strong></h2><p>New Kids on the Block (NKOTB) are one of the longest running boy bands on this list&nbsp;since the group came together in 1984 and, despite a 14-year hiatus between 1994 and 2008, the group continues to record music and sell albums to this day.</p><p>NKOTB has sold over 80 million records since its inception.&nbsp;They were listed as number 16 on Rolling Stone's top 25 Teen Idol Breakout Movements, and on October 9, 2014, they received a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame, making them&nbsp;one of the most successful boy bands we have today. However, the reason why this group is on this list is because people out there tend to believe that Danny Wood is the least attractive member of the group.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-chris-kirkpatrick-nsync><strong>1. Chris Kirkpatrick (NSYNC)</strong></h2><p>When it comes to boy bands, NSYNC is without a doubt one of the best the world has ever seen. Recognized by Rolling Stone as one of the top Teen Idol breakout movements of all time, this boy band sold over 50 million albums over their brief history, making them the eighth best-selling boy band in history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Christopher Allan Kirkpatrick was a member of this amazing group and his amazing countertenor voice made fans - especially the ladies - adore him the world over. Chris still sings, he is a performer as well as a voice actor. However, one thing that most people point out is that Chris was the least attractive of the boys in the group, an opinion that you have the right to agree with or totally refute.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmatp6BifnF5zKiqrWWlo661wNGamq2hppp6o7vYZpmappRiuqa5wZ6prGWVq7Kzew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tommy-lee-mom-vassiliki-papadimitriou-was-miss-greece-contestant-in-1957.html><span>←</span><span>Tommy Lee Mom Vassiliki Papadimitriou Was Miss Greece Contestant In 1957</span></a>
