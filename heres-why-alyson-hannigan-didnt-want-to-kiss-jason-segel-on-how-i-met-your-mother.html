"They sort of showed everything. I was like, 'Wait, you guys, now we won't get to do a reunion because you're telling the future and telling the stories of what we're all gonna do.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Neil Patrick Harris Didn't Want Britney Spears On 'How I Met Your Mother'</a></span></p><p>It might not be a reboot, however, a spinoff is set to take place called 'How I Met Your Father'. The show is set to debut on Hulu, with Hilary Duff at the helm. With the recent news, fans can't help but look back at 'How I Met Your Mother'. Despite all the close connections on the show, little do fans know that at times, things were quite different behind the scenes. Take Marshall and Lily, for example, the two seemed perfect in the show, though off-camera, it was a different story for a particular reason.</p><h2 id=segel-s-bad-habits>Segel's Bad Habits</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lily-and-marshall--e1619101877849.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lily and Marshall did a lot of kissing throughout the seasons. However, little do fans know, Lily wasn't all that content, given a certain bad habit of Segel's. Jason was a big smoker,&nbsp;and during the first seasons, would even smoke on the set between takes. Hannigan admitted with Digital Spy, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it wasn't easy to go through with the scenes</a>, "I cannot stand cigarette smoke. It's like kissing an ashtray and he's trying to be polite by having gum or mints, but it doesn't help.&nbsp;When we started the pilot [for the show] he was like, 'Get me to stop smoking, I'll be your best friend.' So we did this bet where he would owe me $10 every time he had a cigarette. After the first day, he owed me $200. So he said, 'I'm just quitting,' and he quit cold turkey for about a year. It was fantastic but then ... he got stressed out and he started smoking again."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These Are The Best How I Met Your Mother Episodes, According To IMDb</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite that hiccup between the two, Segel and Hannigan got along great and we can say the same for the rest of the cast. Although a reboot isn't taking place, fans can look forward to the spinoff, or simply going back down memory lane and watch the old episodes, which are available on several streaming platforms, including Netflix.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Much Was Neil Patrick Harris Paid For 'How I Met Your Mother'?</a></span></p><p>Sources: Digital Spy & E Online</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmmKWxo6S7brTAp6Win5GjeqW1w6erZq%2BRo8FuwM5moqKro2K3or%2FOp2SsnZeauW67zWafqK9dnnqusdNmsKitomK6sMDHnqlo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sarah-michelle-gellar-net-worth-20-years-after-buffy-the-vampire-slayer.html><span>←</span><span>Here's What Sarah Michelle Gellar's Net Worth Looks Like, 20 Years After Buffy The Vampire Slayer</span></a>
