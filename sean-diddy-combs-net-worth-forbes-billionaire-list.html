Diddy was first certified as a billionaire in 2022 by wealth pundit Zack O'Malley Greenburg. Active in the entertainment industry since 1990, Diddy displayed exceptional talent in hip-hop through music and his business acumen. He established his infamous record label, Bad Boys Records, in 1994, signing his late pal, The Notorious B.I.G. Diddy also served as a producer, working with A-list artists, including TLC, Mariah Carey, Usher, Jodeci, and Lil Kim, among others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/your-paragraph-text-2024-03-27t114921-889.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Parade, <strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Bad Boy Records is valued at over $100 million</a></strong> and has recorded astounding success over the years. The label tally includes 23 platinum singles, 28 gold singles, 27 platinum, and 15 gold albums. Away from music, Sean "Diddy" Combs dabbled in several meaningful business ventures that further proved his excellence in finance. In 1998, the rapper launched a fashion company, Sean John, which reached $450 million at its peak. Towards the end of 2006, the fashion franchise declined after the major retailer, Macy's, severed ties with the brand.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/why-p-diddy-could-spend-the-rest-of-his-life-in-prison-according-to-these-legal-experts-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Why P Diddy Could Spend The Rest Of His Life In Prison According To These Legal Experts">Why P Diddy Could Spend The Rest Of His Life In Prison According To These Legal Experts</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Diddy has the potential of being sentenced to life in prison according to one legal expert.</p><p>In 2007, the father-of-seven extended his ventures into the wine and alcohol industry by partnering with Diageo, the parent company of Ciroc Vodka. <strong>He reportedly made $60 million annually from the proceeds</strong>.

Diddy sold the mansion in 2020 for $4.7 million. In 2004, he bought a 3.5-acre estate in Alpine, New Jersey, and sold it for 5.5 million in 2016.

Dickerson-Neal revealed that she was a college student at the time. Rodney "Lil Rod" Jones, a producer who formerly worked for Diddy, revealed that he faced "unwanted advances" and was forced to engage in sexual activities with sex workers hired by the rapper. Lil Rod also claimed to have video and audio evidence showing Diddy and his associates engaging in "illegal activity."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In response, <strong>Sean "Diddy" Combs vehemently denied all the accusations</strong>, which also<a href=# rel=nofollow> implicated his son, Christian Combs</a>.
