He balled out in high school, he had an immediate impact as a rookie in the NBA, and he's won a couple of championships and MVP trophies throughout his prolific career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>James gets a lot of love and praise for his basketball skills. What he doesn't get enough adoration for is how he's mastered his personal life. According to Forbes, LeBron's a billionaire. He didn't get there just from his basketball accomplishments, as he is certainly a savvy businessman. He's also a devoted family man, with his infamous 'Taco Tuesdays' and public relationship with his son Bronny.</p><p>What's less known is LeBron's relationship with his wife Savannah. They haven't kept things private by any means, but at the same time, most people aren't aware of how in love the two are with each other. Here's just how intense their 21-year-old relationship is, and why they've been able to keep it going for so long.</p><h2 id=how-long-have-lebron-and-savannah-james-been-together><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>How Long Have LeBron And Savannah James Been Together?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/lebron-and-savannah-james.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to The Independent, LeBron and Savannah first started dating back in 2002. They reportedly met in high school, when LeBron famously attended St. Vincent-St. Mary High School. Savannah actually went to a rival school, Buchtel High School. It took a while for them to start dating, despite LeBron's persistence.</p><p>It's starting to become less common for high school sweethearts to get married, although it certainly still happens. Legendary rapper <a href=#>Snoop Dogg married his high school sweetheart Shante Taylor</a>, and so has fellow athlete Patrick Mahomes.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How LeBron James' Wife Has Supported His Career</a></span></p><p>Once things started going really well, the two were very committed to each other. According to an interview Savannah did with Harper's Bazaar, she had concerns about their relationship once LeBron entered the NBA. Things got much crazier once their child Bronny was born in 2004, but it certainly didn't slow things down. They would have 2 more children together before getting married in 2013.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-did-lebron-and-savannah-james-get-married><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>When Did LeBron And Savannah James Get Married?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/savannah-james-smiling.jpg><p><a href=#>There are celebs such as Beyonce and Jay-Z</a> who have had very private weddings, and then there are celebs such as rapper <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, who famously had a very public ceremony</a>. LeBron and Savannah's special wedding service was originally a private event, but over the years, the details have been revealed by those that attended.</p><p>LeBron and Savannah have also opened up about the wedding, with the two of them sharing wedding pictures years after on social media. According to LeBron in an interview with CBS, the two held their wedding in a San Diego resort. Of course, James noted that the ceremony had super tight security, with guests even having their phones taken away to avoid any leaked images or videos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=where-did-lebron-and-savannah-james-honeymoon><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Where Did LeBron And Savannah James Honeymoon?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/savannah-james-simone-panella-and-lebron-james.jpg><p>LeBron and Savannah <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">held their honeymoon in Italy</a> immediately after their wedding. The two of them uploaded a plethora of pictures to their Instagram involving their honeymoon, and the places they visited.</p><p>For instance, LeBron put up a picture of himself and Savannah hanging out with the prominent Italian chef Simone Panella. That was just one of many places the newlyweds visited, alongside iconic places like The Colosseum.</p><h2 id=inside-lebron-and-savannah-james-39-exotic-vacations><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Inside LeBron And Savannah James' Exotic Vacations</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lebron-james-family.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When LeBron isn't busy balling out in the NBA, he's going on vacations with his family in the offseason. According to People, after the Lakers were officially eliminated from the 2022 NBA playoffs, LeBron and Savannah visited the Maldives private island alone. A few months later, the entire James family was seen in Turks.</p><h2 id=lebron-and-savannah-james-go-on-a-lot-of-dinner-dates><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>LeBron And Savannah James Go On A Lot Of Dinner Dates</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/lebron-and-savannah-james-1.jpg><p>Sometimes LeBron and Savannah are able to take private vacations together. However, the two parents care too much about their children to constantly leave them behind for long periods of time. The solution to that is to have simple yet romantic dinner dates, of course.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Insider, their first date ever was at Outback Steakhouse. As good as that place may be, their date selections have gotten more boujee over the years. An example of this is a date they had earlier this year. According to Hollywood Life, the two privately ate out at the Sunset Tower Hotel in West Hollywood back in January. Pictures of the pair showed them having some really close PDA.</p><p>While these aren't necessarily exclusive to just LeBron and Savannah, James is known for his Taco Tuesdays due to his endless social media posts about them. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LeBron even tried to trademark 'Taco Tuesday'</a>, but he was rejected by the US Patent Office.</p><h2 id=lebron-james-lovingly-supported-savannah-39-s-business-the-juice-spot><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>LeBron James Lovingly Supported Savannah's Business The Juice Spot</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/lebron-and-savannah-sitting.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>LeBron has made a lot of money moves</a>, whether it be his endless endorsements or his various business investments.

According to Miami New Times, the place was located at 1800 SW First Ave, towards the south end of the city. Given its location near the beach and a lot of high-end apartments, it was pretty popular. Of course, it also drew a lot of customers because of LeBron's involvement.</p><p>According to The Miami Herald, the place existed from 2011 to 2015. That's right, The Juice Spot actually remained open for over a year after LeBron left the Miami Heat for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Still, LeBron's involvement certainly meant a lot to their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lebron-and-savannah-james-work-out-together><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>LeBron And Savannah James Work Out Together</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lebron-james-pre-game.jpg><p>This one shouldn't be much of a surprise, given LeBron's career. However, it still is very heartwarming that The King lets his wife help him work out. Not every athlete wants to have their family members work out with them, as it is very important to their career that they exercise carefully.</p><p>LeBron clearly doesn't have that issue at all. The two of them post exercise videos to their social media all the time, regardless if they're working out with each other or not. In 2018, Savannah posted a series of videos to her Instagram Story of her doing exercises such as lunges and squats. LeBron was not only with her, but the gym mirror in the background showed that he was the one filming everything.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lebron-and-savannah-james-support-their-son-bronny-together><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>LeBron And Savannah James Support Their Son Bronny Together</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bronny-and-lebron-james.jpg><p>Naturally, LeBron and Savannah's children play a big part in their marriage. They may go on private vacations and dates with each other, but most of what they do together involve their children.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is LeBron James’ Son Bryce Maximus James And Why Does He Have Such An Impressive Instagram Following?</a></span></p><p>A case in point is their famous son Bronny. He is in all likelihood a future NBA star, with LeBron telling ESPN in an interview that he won't retire until he gets to play with Bronny.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like most moms, Savannah loves her children to the point they're her everything. Most of her Instagram pictures and videos are about her kids, and of course, she posts Bronny's highlights whenever she can. The most recent example of this was when she uploaded videos of Bronny's performance at the 2023 McDonald's All-American Game.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijnpqipLtutsCmnKxlo6W8tr%2FEZqqarpGju6K0jKucpZmknryvv8eip2abmJa7qLHDZqOinpVk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paris-hilton-carter-reum-kathy-hilton-family-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Is Everyone Worth In 2021?</span></a>
