Five months later, Tommy dropped the asking price to $4,650,000 before removing the house from the market in February 2018. Three months later, he put the home up for sale again at $4,650,000 before removing it in May 2019. The house was placed back on the market in May 2020 for $4,599,000 before the listing was removed in May 2021. The house is now back on the market for that same price.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Mötley Crüe drummer acquired the Calabasas property back in 2007 for $5.85 million, which means that even with a full-price sale the platinum-selling pop culture icon is looking at a loss of about $1.25 million, not counting real estate fees. The elaborately tattooed heavy metal musician, now 59, first tried to sell in 2016, with an asking price pushing up on six million bucks. Since then the property has been on and off the market almost a dozen times.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/91B87359-2065-4506-B921-C82DA1417ACA.jpeg><p>Set on over a quarter of an acre of hillside property in a gated enclave above the Calabasas Country Club, with an over-the-rooftops city-lights view, the nearly 10,000-square-foot house, with half a dozen bedrooms and eight bathrooms, stands two low-profile stories atop a partially subterranean four-car garage.

At the core of the house, a soaring, tropically planted triple-height atrium is topped by a retractable glass roof that showers the center of the house with natural light and air, according to <a href=#><i>Dirt</i></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/074E87D1-015B-4E35-BEBC-601976C23CDD.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Each corner of the dining room has a lighted display cabinet filled with curious curios and the forest green walls of the library/office are hung with a trove of industry accolades, including a plaque commemorating Mötley Crüe’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Huge and chockablock with high-quality designer appliances, the kitchen is arranged around a giant center island, while the nearby family room has a stone fireplace and glass sliders for easy-breezy access to the pool.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/4EAF6AA6-AE4E-4E05-AD6E-99BFCCA79347.jpeg><p>There’s a baby grand piano in Lee’s moody, monochromatically black and grey main-floor bedroom, perfect for early morning and late-night ticking of the ivories.

A lush central atrium with natural tropic open to the sky with a retractable roof illumines natural light throughout. Uniquely modeled with the flow and scale far and wide. A spacious chef's kitchen with center island, stainless steel appliances and granite counters. Entertainers living and dining room, a spacious office/library with a private terrace. The main level Master Suite with personalized tranquility, large scale glass doors slide open to the beautiful outdoor space with a private pool and spa overlooking the city views. A large walk-in closet generously scaled for ample space to both his and hers adjacent to a beautifully appointed master spa. The lower level offers a true compound made for imagination, creativity and inspiration. A professional recording studio skillfully engineered with isolation booths and a control room. Adjacent is a home screening room and personal concession bar as well as lower-level dining and wine tasting quarters. Lower level garage parking and ample storage. This magnificent compound is truly a unique offering for the creative lifestyle it demands,” according to the official description of the house courtesy of agent Emil Hartoonian of The Agency.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lee sold his last house, in nearby Malibu, in late 2004 for $2,475,000, according to public records.
