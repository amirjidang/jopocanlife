In an interview, Akon opened up about what it was like to work with Eminem in the studio. The singer was stunned when he saw that Eminem approached his studio time like a normal job.</p><p>Let's hear what Akon had to say, and learn how the two came together to drop a song that was a massive radio hit.</p><h2 id=akon-and-eminem-have-had-wildly-successful-careers>Akon And Eminem Have Had Wildly Successful Careers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar52115676.jpg><p>In the vast symphony of the music industry, two names reverberate with an undying resonance: Akon and Eminem. These musical maestros have left an indelible mark, not just on the charts but on the very soul of the music world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Akon, born Aliaune Thiam, emerged from the crucible of musical obscurity in St. Louis, Missouri. His ascendancy to the zenith of the music industry was not meteoric but measured. His debut album, Trouble, released in 2004, was a veritable sensation. It spawned hits like "Locked Up" and "Lonely," each a testament to Akon's emotive vocal prowess.</p><p>Eminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, hails from Detroit, Michigan. His journey into the rap pantheon is one of grit and resilience, marked by a tumultuous personal life. His debut album, Infinite, barely made a ripple in the industry, but it was just the first chapter of his storied career.</p><p>Eminem's lyrical prowess and storytelling abilities have earned him a throne in the pantheon of rap legends, influencing a generation of artists. His willingness to tackle personal demons, addiction, and societal issues in his music has made him a voice for those grappling with similar challenges.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These two giants have collaborated, and in an interview, Akon opened up about how Eminem tackles things in the studio.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Brittany Murphy Admitted She Had To Be Very Careful When Answering A Certain Eminem Question</a></span></p><h2 id=akon-described-eminem-39-s-process-in-the-studio-as-9-to-5>Akon Described Eminem's Process In The Studio As 9 To 5</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hot New Hip Hop</a>, Akon described Eminem treating his studio time like a normal job.</p><p>"He was the first artist I worked with who treated the business like a real job," Akon said.</p><p>The singer continued, shedding some light on how the two approached things differently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He comes in at 9 Am every day to the studio, takes his lunch break at 1, and is out of there by 5 PM. It’s like a schedule. I didn’t expect that from him. The first day I come, I come around 6. Like we going to do an evening session. I get to the studio, they said ‘Em just left!’ He said ‘I’m out of here!’ I said ‘I just got to the studio, you coming back here?’ He said, ‘yeah, I’ll be back there at 9 AM," Akon continued.</p><p>As Akon's story continued, he talked about how the legendary rapper even took a normal lunch break.</p><p>"Plays some beats, we vibing. Em’s like, ‘yo I’m about to go out for lunch.’ I said I’ll meet you after…He goes takes his lunch, after an hour comes back. I play him the record, play him the chorus. He’s like oh, this is it!”</p><p>It's such a stark contrast to the way other people approach studio time, but to Eminem's credit, he understands that his studio time should not dominate his entire life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As this portion of the interview winded down, Akon admitted that Eminem has a great way of doing things.</p><p>"I was like ‘damn, he’s right. Some days I’m in the studio three, four days. I don’t come out. Don’t see my kids, don’t call my wife, none of that. I’m sitting here like, [Em’s way] makes a lot of sense. Ain’t nothing gon’ change between today and tomorrow, the singer said.</p><p>Despite their schedule differences, their collab was a major hit.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Taylor Swift Had One Specific Reason For Surprisingly Playing Eminem's Lose Yourself In Concert</a></span></p><h2 id=akon-and-eminem-39-s-collab-was-a-major-hit>Akon And Eminem's Collab Was A Major Hit</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar45815867.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Smack That" made its grand entrance into the music scene in 2006, immediately striking a chord with listeners of all ages.
