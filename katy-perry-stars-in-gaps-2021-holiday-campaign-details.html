Because get this: Perry kicked off her career “folding sweatshirts” for the fashion brand nearly 20 years ago.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“It’s a bit of a full circle moment because my <a href=#>first ever paying job</a>, aside from cleaning houses or something like that was at a Gap in Santa Barbara,” the “California Girls” signer told <a href=#>Vogue</a>. “I would fold the fleeces during the Holidays.”</p><p class=p1>She continued: “The Gap had these playlists that had all these up-and-coming artists in it. Like I dreamed about making that playlist. The idea that I get to be in a Gap commercial, it was a bucket list moment.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Add that little tidbit of information to the fact that Perry got to do a cover of the Beatles’ “All You Need Is Love” and the whole commercial is a dream come true.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“I feel like these Gap commercials are iconic,” she told the outlet. “You’ve seen them for decades and all my icons have been in one. <a href=#><strong>Orlando</strong></a> [Bloom] was in one of them. I finally got my own moment.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Plus, having the chance to rock a bunch of clothes from the brand — including a staple black hoodie, basic denim jacket and hot pink sweat set — made Perry feel “really cool.” She explained, “If I get the opportunity to glum up or wear hair and makeup, I’m like, ‘Okay, let’s find something with sequins.’ But, I put on some fuchsia <a href=# data-link=1>sweats</a> and it feels good.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>To make the opportunity that much sweeter, Gap is donating $1 per Spotify stream of Perry’s new song to Baby 2 Baby, which has a mission “to provide basic essentials to children living in poverty across the country.”</p><p class=p1>The campaign as a whole has been received with tons of applause — just take a look at the comments on Perry’s Instagram. “This is the best! Getting me in the xmas spirit and doing good? Love it,” a user wrote. Another person added: “Thanks for blessing our ears with this cover.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6CutcWMqZyrqqliwLWt0axkoqZdnK6xv4xrZ2tpXZ28rbXDmrBmm5GivaK1xqdknZ2klratv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kathryn-crosby-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Kathryn Crosby Net Worth How Much is Kathryn Crosby Worth?</span></a>
