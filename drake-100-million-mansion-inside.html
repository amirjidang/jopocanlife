He <a href=#>may make headlines for his massive Air Drake</a>, which is often referred to as "a mansion in the sky." However, he also has a mansion on the ground, appropriately named "The Embassy."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-name>The Name</h2><p>Calling his home&nbsp;"The Embassy" is more than just a witty way to upgrade the term "house". It's genuinely based on architectural designs from traditional Beaux Arts architecture, albeit with a more contemporary spin.</p><p>“In form, materials, and execution, the structure is a proper 19th-century limestone mansion. But the exterior profiles are more minimal and the lines are a bit cleaner,” Rafauli, the head of a top notch self-titled luxury design/build firm based in Ontario, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest</a>. “This isn’t stucco, paint, and fake gold. That’s not what Drake wanted, and that’s not what I do.”</p><p>What do&nbsp;they do? Modern Art Deco, with special detail given to the desires and the elegant approach that <a href=#>Drizzy puts forth in all of his projects</a>.&nbsp;Referred to by its owner as&nbsp;overwhelming high luxury, The Embassy is larger than life in every sense of the word. As everything from the size of the rooms to the materials used to the attention to detail given to overall design, he made sure that everything within was worthy of the word mansion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Flying Like Drake: What's Inside The Musician's $185 Million Private Jet</a></span></p><h2 id=the-size>The Size</h2><p><a href=#>The gigantic rooms</a> are one of the first things that anyone would notice as they catch the eye immediately upon entry. Connected by limestone hallways, adorned with Nero Marquina marble, they take the breath away at first glance.</p><p>The easiest example to cite when pointing to the enormity of his home is "The Great Room", which is more than a clever nickname. This room is, well, great, spanning a monstrous 44 feet high, and welcoming guests with a glimpse of all to come.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, if you need a simple way to sum up the humungous nature of the residence, there is one simple three word phrase that anyone can relate to - two-story closet. Yet, the massive nature of it all isn't limited to the inside as the entire building is covered in 1,100 feet of outdoor terraces, allowing the star and his guests to step outside, where the sky reaches slightly higher than his vaulted ceilings.</p><p>He can welcome a large number of guests easily as parking is plentiful.&nbsp;At least ten different cars can fit in the garage, although the space is usually <a href=#>full of his own roster of rides</a>. Still, it's just another aspect of his larger than life-style.</p><h2 id=the-practicality>The Practicality</h2><p>The home might be huge, but it needs to be personal in order to feel like home. That's why, in addition to the musical influence, The Embassy features Drake's NBA love throughout its walls. It not only sports a regulation sized basketball court, but also houses a lounge overflowing with his action figure collection. Add to that an entire room to house his massive array of awards, aptly titled "The Awards Room", and a hallway lined with NBA Jerseys, and it turns this gigantic dwelling into a personal display of all things Drake.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Decadence, however, can also be useful. Everyone needs to sleep and, when it's time for <a href=#>Drake</a> to turn in for the night, The Embassy is ready to welcome him to dreamland in a 3,200 square foot master bedroom. If the bedroom space doesn't blow you away, the bathtub in the master bath will. His black marble tub weighs in at a staggering 4,000 pounds and was carved from one single piece of marble.</p><h2 id=the-deco>The Deco</h2><p>Showcasing a concert grand piano from Austrian piano manufacturer Bösendorfer and designed along with Japanese artist Takashi Murakami, the musical influence is one that anyone familiar with the star's love of melody would expect in such a spacious residence.</p><p>“Drake’s world completely revolves around music, so he wasn’t going to buy just any piano. This prized possession is an authentic marriage of artistry, craft, and quality,” Rafauli explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The piano might provide the soundtrack, but it useless if you can't see the keys to use it. That's why the star's other major piece of home deco is both impressive and useful. He is also the proud owner of a replica of the Metropolitan chandelier with more than 20,000 hand-cut pieces of Swarovski crystal, making it the second largest of its kind in the entire world.</p><p>While many of us might not be able to relate to such a high-end product like a crystal chandelier or Austrian piano, Drizzy does sport one in-home item that any man with a cave of his own can relate to - a neon-lit singing toilet.</p><p>He may have <a href=#>started at the bottom</a>, but being here has its perks. For the Canadian star, The Embassy is where he hangs his hat. Those who love seeing him live should be thankful. With doors like these ready to welcome you back, it's a wonder he ever leaves at all.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Drake Topples Taylor Swift's Spotify Stream Record</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>L.A.
