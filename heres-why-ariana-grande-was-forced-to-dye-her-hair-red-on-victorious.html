Of course, gaining critical acclaim for our hard work always makes for a good day. Anybody, whether talented or not, would love to make it into showbiz. <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Grande</a></strong> always reaffirms that she’s thankful for the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">opportunities she’s been given in Hollywood</a>. She’s even thankful for her time spent on the Nickelodeon show Victorious. Looking back on the show, no one would’ve predicted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she’d become the </a>award winning, powerhouse singer, she is today. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It’s like day and night with the songstress.</a> Though, don’t get us wrong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ariana Grande had plenty of star power on Victorious just as she does now. In fact, fans deemed Grande’s character Cat Valentine a fan favorite on the show. Whether it had to do with her catchphrase “What do you mean?” or her singing, fans couldn’t get enough of Cat Valentine. More importantly, fans obsessed over her red hair. Little do fans realize that Ariana Grande’s red hair became a huge burden on the star.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">From 'Thank U, Next' To 'Dangerous Woman': Ariana Grande's Biggest Moments In Music History</a></span></p><h2 id=why-did-ariana-grande-have-to-die-her-hair-red>Why Did Ariana Grande Have To Die Her Hair Red?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Actors have admitted to often altering their bodies to meet the requirements for a particular acting role. Often actors playing Marvel or DC real-life heroes have to stick to a strict diet and exercise routine. The next time fans see them, they’re buffed and ripped to the max. In other cases, actors lose weight or in some extremes, wear prosthetics. For the Nickelodeon show Victorious, Ariana Grande only had to die her hair candy-apple red.</p><p>While everyone loved Cat Valentine’s red hair, the decision for the hair color change didn’t come from Ariana Grande herself. In fact, Victorious’s show creator Dan Schneider demanded that the rising star change her hair color to red, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">simply because he didn’t want his entire female cask as brunettes</a>. Sources don’t necessarily explain the reasoning behind Schneider’s choice for red hair. Though, given all the controversy surrounding Schneider’s predatory nature of young girls, we’d bet the request was intentional.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Grande Celebrates The 10 Year Anniversary Of 'Victorious'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ariana-grande-suffered-at-the-mercy-of-her-red-hair>Ariana Grande Suffered At The Mercy Of Her Red Hair</h2><p>While Ariana Grande’s hair change doesn’t compare to the trials and tribulations actors face with their individual transformations, it proved quite distressing for the young actress. Due to the show's shooting schedule, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Grande dyed her hair every other week</a>, throughout the show’s four seasons. No wonder her hair fell out. The 27-year-old told several publications that her natural brunette hair was so damaged, that she tried on wigs, weaves, and the like, but nothing worked. It wasn’t until she tried on her a simple ponytail that the star could finally stop worrying about her hair. Though, what started off as a temporary solution to a problem, soon became the star’s signature look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since her days on Victorious, fans have shown admiration and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fixation over the star’s hair evolution</a>. Ariana Grande’s ponytail has even evolved over the years, from blonde to silvery-white, bangs, ombre curls, and as of recently, two ponytails. Who knew a girl could style a ponytail in so many different ways and still make it look fashionable? While fans may miss her red tresses, we love the star’s signature ponytail just as much.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Believe Ariana Grande And Jhene Aiko Have Been Feuding Over Big Sean For Years</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmmKuhkaOubrPRmqWdnV2srrR5xaipnJ2UYsGwecOynGaglad6qa3Iq2SrnZRivK951aKaraeinry2v44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ghost-story-podcast.html><span>←</span><span>Ghost Story Podcast Top Ghost Story Podcasts in 2024</span></a>
