And, when you’ve been hosting a radio show and deejaying for as long as Flex has—he’s been doing in the music biz for more than two decades now—those offensive moments add up. So, it should come as no surprise to hear that, over the course of his career, Flex has endured beefs with a number of different rappers, celebrities, and fellow DJs.<span id=more-100770></span></p><p>Most recently, Flex got into a heated argument with <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_nicki-minaj_3 data-tag=nicki-minaj>Nicki Minaj</a></strong> on his <strong>Hot 97</strong> radio show on Monday night—just 24 hours after Ms. Minaj refused to participate in <strong>Hot 97’s Summer Jam concert</strong> because of some comments made by Hot 97 morning show host <strong>Peter Rosenberg</strong>. If you haven’t heard Flex’s “interview” with the female MC yet, check out some of the highlights <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p>That’s just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Flex’s crazy beefs, though. He’s been in the game for a long time, so naturally he’s been through worse and gotten into crazier beefs in the past. So, now that the <a href=# id=auto-tag_beef_3 data-tag=beef>beef</a> with Nicki seems to have subsided, we decided to put together a list of <strong>The 10 Craziest Beefs of Funkmaster Flex’s Career</strong>. From his supposed beef with a rap icon to his war of words with a rival DJ, Flex has traded barbs with the best of ’em.—Chris Yuscavage</p><p><strong>The Beef:</strong> Funkmaster Flex vs. 2Pac<br><strong>Why They Were Beefing:</strong> Obviously, “they” weren’t beefing, because ‘Pac had passed away. But, in early 2010, Flex took the stage at a concert in New York City and made some really inflammatory remarks about him. “There are those that don’t f— with 2Pac,” he said. “Fuck n—– sucking 2Pac’s d—. I don’t suck 2Pac’s d—. Make some noise if you miss f—— Biggie Smalls. Brooklyn, let’s go!”<br><strong>The Outcome:</strong> It took awhile, but a few months after a clip of Flex making his remarks hit YouTube, all the rap blogs posted it and it caused a lot of controversy. For his part, Flex explained himself by saying that he understood why people were offended by his comments but that he never felt any “good energy” from ‘Pac when he was alive. “I don’t have to love him like that,” he said.</p><p><strong>The Beef:</strong> Funkmaster Flex vs. Steph Lova<br><strong>Why They Were Beefing:</strong> In 2002, Steph—a DJ at Hot 97’s rival station Power 105—did an interview with Nas, during which he accused Flex of accepting payola to play records. As a result, Flex took it out on Steph by allegedly assaulting her when he ran into her one day later that year.<br><strong>The Outcome:</strong> Flex was arrested and charged with third-degree assault. He later pled guilty to harassment and agreed to stay away from Steph.</p><p><strong>The Beef:</strong> Funkmaster Flex vs. Olivia<br><strong>Why They Were Beefing:</strong> During an on-air interview in early 2012, the former G-Unit songstress called Flex out for clowning her after her departure from 50 Cent’s group. The interview featured a lot of tense moments and made for great radio as the two traded disses back and forth for most of it.<br><strong>The Outcome:</strong> By the end of the interview, Flex and Olivia had seemingly patched things up and made nice. They’re not exactly BFFs these days, but it seems like they’ve decided to forget about whatever rift existed between them after Olivia and 50 Cent parted ways.</p><p><strong>The Beef:</strong> Funkmaster Flex vs. R. Kelly<br><strong>Why They Were Beefing:</strong> After R. Kelly did his now-infamous “How old are we talking?” BET interview in 2008, Flex called him out for admitting that he likes teenage girls. “Let me be so specific to tell you, fam, with your funny-looking Member Only’s jacket, your funny beard, and the dumb Mel Brooks look you had on your face,” he said during a video filmed at Hot 97, “there is an issue here because we’re talking about little children, teenagers, kids.”<br><strong>The Outcome:</strong> Flex’s rant against Kells was epic in every sense of the word and really summed up the general reaction to the BET interview. This was more of a one-sided beef, because Flex never got a response from Kells. But, it was still a really crazy beef nonetheless.</p><p><strong>The Beef:</strong> Funkmaster Flex vs. Faizon Love<br><strong>Why They Were Beefing:</strong> R. Kelly didn’t respond to Flex. So, for whatever reason, Faizon Love took it upon himself to do it for him by telling Flex to mind his own business in a clip that he posted on YouTube. He later explained that he doesn’t know Kells but that he didn’t think Flex was right for going at him like he did.<br><strong>The Outcome:</strong> After a couple of weeks, this beef blew over because it didn’t make a whole lot of sense. To Flex’s credit, he did an interview shortly after he put out his video dissing R. Kelly and said that he did it because he always felt that he should have stood up and spoken out against R. Kelly’s behavior. But, as far as Faizon’s shots at him, he pretty much ignored them and moved on with his life.</p><p><strong>The Beef:</strong> Funkmaster Flex vs. Christina Milian<br><strong>Why They Were Beefing:</strong> Shortly after Christina and The-Dream’s marriage ended, Flex went on the radio and made fun of the fact that their union was over. Milian took to her Twitter account to address Flex directly. “when will u just leave me alone and get a life?” she asked him. “all uve ever done is pick on me. What’s ur problem dude? Go away.”<br><strong>The Outcome:</strong> Although Flex had said that he was going to air Milian out months before he actually did, he apparently thought better of it once she contacted him on Twitter and he apologized to her. “i was joking,” he wrote. “i will give you a break. wasnt personal. ps i dont agree with what the dream did. love to your little one.”</p><p><strong>The Beef:</strong> Funkmaster Flex vs. Khia<br><strong>Why They Were Beefing:</strong> Earlier this year, Khia called Flex out (on Twitter, of course!) for posting NSFW photos of her on his blog, In Flex We Trust. She had actually released the photos herself through her Twitter account after they leaked onto the Internet.<br><strong>The Outcome:</strong> This beef was very short-lived, mostly because Flex responded by saying, “all i did was put the pics on my blog and retweet a tweet…Why are you mad at me?” That was the end of it.</p><p><strong>The Beef:</strong> Funkmaster Flex vs. Interscope executive Nino Cuccinello<br><strong>Why They Were Beefing:</strong> We’re not sure why Flex was so mad at Nino or Interscope. But, back in early 2009, Flex went on his Hot 97 radio show and announced that he would no longer be playing any records put out by Interscope. “Interscope Records, nothin’ is spinning,” he said on the air. “I want us all to be friends, but Nino is not a friend of ours. I will go on with this. Nino, you got 24 hours to fix yourself or this goes someplace else tomorrow…Nino is the only one I’m letting off today. Tomorrow, I’m teeing off on the whole team.”<br><strong>The Outcome:</strong> We’re still not sure exactly why Flex had beef with Nino or Interscope. But, shortly after his rant, Hot 97 denied that they would stop playing Interscope artists like 50 Cent, Eminem, and Soulja Boy. Hot 97 Program Director Ebro Darden even said that Flex hadn’t been speaking on behalf on the station that night. “We’ve never held back on a whole label’s music,” he said, “and we won’t.”</p><p><strong>The Beef:</strong> Funkmaster Flex vs. Amber Rose<br><strong>Why They Were Beefing:</strong> During a 2010 interview with Kanye West, Flex took a few shots at his ex Amber Rose and said “she seems like she’s not smooth, my brother.” That led to Amber taking some shots at him on Twitter and then taking some more shots at him during a 2011 appearance on Cipha Sounds and Peter Rosenberg’s Hot 97 morning show. “He’s an a——,” she said. “He’s just ignorant in every single way possible.”<br><strong>The Outcome:</strong> Amber thought better of her comments later and apologized to Flex on Twitter. They patched things up earlier this year when she appeared on Flex’s show.</p><p><strong>The Beef:</strong> Funkmaster Flex vs. DJ Clue<br><strong>Why They Were Beefing:</strong> C’mon now. You didn’t really think we’d leave this one off the list, did you? These two have been going back and forth for years now. Flex has thrown shots at Clue. Clue has thrown shots at Flex. They’ve exchanged disses over the radio. And, well, we don’t see it stopping anytime soon. They hate each other in every sense of the word.<br><strong>The Outcome:</strong> As long as Flex works at Hot 97 and Clue works at Power 105—and, realistically, probably even when both of them move on—there will be always be beef between these two. A lot of the other beefs on this list might be over. But, this one will continue to live on. Crazy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX2Z9bq%2FRmrGinaOpeqOxxJ%2BqZp6lo7iurdKtnKtllqGyub%2BMnJirnZWnenJ8j3BuaWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shantel-vansanten-husband-victor-webster-split-after-3-weddings.html><span>←</span><span>Shantel VanSanten, Husband Victor Webster Split After 3 Weddings</span></a>
