The latter also recently starred in a sci-fi rom com titled Meet Cute, although the film has not been very well received by critics and viewers.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What James Franco Has To Do With The Johnny Depp And Amber Heard Trial</h2><time>Aug 11, 2024</time>

For anyone who doesn't know, Bale laid into cinematographer Shane Hurlbut during a heated confrontation on the set of Terminator: Salvation.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Will Donald Trump talk about Waco siege at Texas rally days after Netflix documentary on standoff dr</h2><time>Aug 11, 2024</time>
