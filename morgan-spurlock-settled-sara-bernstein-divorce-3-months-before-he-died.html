Bernstein filed for divorce five years later in March 2021.</p><p class=p1>Spurlock and Bernstein reached a settlement in February of this year, and a proposed judgment was issued within weeks. Per the court records obtained by Us Weekly, a letter had been filed in court earlier this month. There have not been further updates about finalizing the case. <i>Us </i>has reached out to lawyers for both parties for comment.</p><p class=p1>“It’s heartbreaking news. I know Morgan as a wonderful person to work for and was very appreciative of his family and devoted to the health and wellbeing of his children,” Spurlock’s attorney <strong>Randi L. Karmel</strong>&nbsp;told <i>Us </i>in a statement. “My thoughts are with his family at this difficult time. He was very young and has two young children. They amicably settled all issues between them prior to his death.”</p><p class=p1><i>&nbsp;</i>News broke on Friday, May 24, that Spurlock had <a href=#>died one day earlier</a> following a cancer battle.</p><p class=p1>“It was a sad day, as we said goodbye to my brother Morgan,” the director’s brother <strong>Craig Spurlock</strong> said in a statement. “Morgan gave so much through his art, ideas, and generosity. The world has lost a true creative genius and a special man. I am so proud to have worked together with him.”</p><p class=p1>Morgan is survived by his parents, two brothers and his two sons. In addition to Kallen, Morgan shared Laken, 17, with ex-wife <strong>Alexandra Jamieson</strong>. (In the May obituary, Bernstein and Jamieson are both listed as Morgan’s “former spouses.”)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Morgan and Jamieson, a vegan chef, started dating in 2002. She appeared in <i>Super Size Me</i>, supporting Morgan’s 30-day experiment of eating nothing but McDonald’s meals. Morgan and Jamieson wed in 2006 and separated five years later.</p><p class=p1>“I was there with him and we were in a relationship for many years. We were very comfortable with each other,” Jamieson said during a 2013 interview for the <a href=# rel=noopener>Good Life Project </a>about costarring with Morgan in the Oscar-nominated documentary. “[It] was helpful to be there with your partner.”</p><p class=p1>She continued, “We ended up making another TV show called <i>30 Days </i>after <i>Super Size Me</i>, which I was in a couple of episodes with him. We went and lived on minimum wage for a month and it was really a reality show that explored social issues in a way that <i>Super Size Me </i>did. It was hard on the relationship, not only are you going through a challenging experiment but you have to get up at 4:30 [in the morning] because the cameras are coming over. It’s just a very unrealistic environment, in which to communicate and be intimate with somebody.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamp6Kcrq950qmsq6SfmLhuv8Stq6WdlGLAor7AZpmeqp6owaa1zWaboq6fp7CmeZJmpKimpJ3Abq7En6arnV2dsm6wyJ6baA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./uncategorized.html><span>←</span><span>Mia Talerico Net Worth How Much is Mia Talerico Worth?</span></a>
