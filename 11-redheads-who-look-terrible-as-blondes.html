Only 1-2% of the population has natural red hair, so it is surprising that all you have to do is look to the stars (the Hollywood stars, that is) and there are so many- Isla Fisher, Debra Messing, Julianne Moore, the list goes on. And I never realized it until compiling this list, but more often than not, actresses play characters using their own hair color than they play characters that require a dye job. Maybe this is precisely because they are redheads, but who knows?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But alas, there will be times when they need to go blonde, or brunette, or even darker, for a role. Or perhaps they just feel like it. Can't say I haven't done the same. These 11 famous women have either gone from a red dye job to blonde, or were born with red hair and tried out being blonde. Whatever the case, they all have one thing in common: looking better as a redhead! It seems as if light hair does nothing but wash them out, while the darker red hair accentuates their features, and just all around looks healthier and shinier. Come to think of it, dark hair is always more shiny than light hair, and I question if I have ever even seen truly shiny blonde hair, except in a shampoo commercial.</p><p>Who are these fair women? Read on to find out, and see if you agree that they should never lighten their hair again!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-rachel-mcadams><strong>11. Rachel McAdams</strong></h2><p>I'm not even sure what <a href=#>Rachel McAdams</a>' natural hair color is anymore, to tell you the truth. She was blonde in Mean Girls, brunette in Red Eye, and had reddish locks in The Notebook. Though the actress would look gorgeous even wearing a paper sack, I think she looks better with red hair than blonde. Just my opinion. That or brown hair, which is what she has had for the majority of her films, such as The Family Stone, The Vow, and About Time. I am gonna go out on a limb and say brown is probably her natural color.</p><p></p><h2 id=10-miley-cyrus><strong>10. Miley Cyrus</strong></h2><p>Ok, it is not just this particular picture, I swear. But <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> and her hair... we have seen everything from a bleach blonde punk rock buzz to long, flowing auburn tendrils and everything in between. Truth be told, Miley can pull off many looks. When she first rose to fame as teen superstar/regular kid in the Disney Channel's Hannah Montana, she sported a long straight golden mane, alternating with wavy darker locks. But that was ages ago now, and in the time since her Disney days, the singer has tried pretty much every hairdo you can imagine. Seeing her side by side with both red and blonde hair, I think she looks much better with the red.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=9-lindsay-lohan><strong>9. Lindsay Lohan</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a>'s hair saga over the years is much like Miley's. She too has put her mane through the ringer - red, black, blonde, brunette. You name it, Lindsay has had it. She is a pretty girl, if a bit troubled, and a natural redhead. Her breakout role was playing twins Hallie and Annie in the 1998 remake of The Parent Trap, and her red-orange hair and freckles were somewhat of a trademark. She was so cute at 12 years old, but now has somewhat of a reputation for partying too hard and getting DUIs. I am of the mind that she looks stunning with her naturally colored red hair, especially when compared to her damaged, frizzy bleach blonde look.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-laura-prepon><strong>8. Laura Prepon</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Laura Prepon</a> is another natural ginger, though most recently she has sported raven black hair for her role as Alex Vause on the Netflix Original Series Orange is the New Black. She looks pretty good with the dark, dark hair, but fans are more accustomed to seeing her with her normal red hair, a la That 70's Show. It was her breakout role and she played Donna Pinciotti for 8 seasons, though in the later years Donna became a blonde. I think that the lighter hair washes her out, a common problem with flaxen-colored hair.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-kate-mara><strong>7. Kate Mara</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kate Mara</a> has played a spectrum of characters over the years in such productions as House of Cards, The Martian, Fantastic Four, and 127 Hours, among many others. Her various portrayals are all vastly different, of course, as are their hairstyles. Like many of her fellow women on this list, Kate has had every color hair under the sun- well, you know, the standard blonde-black-red-brown. I think, like Laura Prepon above, that she also looks washed out with blonde hair, and I much prefer the red color that is closer to her natural one.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-julianne-moore><strong>6. Julianne Moore</strong></h2><p>She is one of the most famous natural redhead actresses in Hollywood, the talented <a href=#>Julianne Moore</a>. She has of course had different hair for different roles, and those 'do's have also spanned the spectrum, including a silver gray that was actually pretty in the recent Hunger Games films. But she always looks best with her signature red locks. Besides the Hunger Games trilogy, other films on her repertoire are Non-Stop, The Kids Are Alright, and Children of Men. She has so many more to list, and it seems as if she stays a redhead more often than not. In all of the aforementioned, for example, she was.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-julia-roberts><strong>5. Julia Roberts</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Julia Roberts</a> is one of America's sweethearts, and a true Pretty Woman (in the literal sense, not what her film of the same name would imply, of course). From playing a blonde trailer park mom in Erin&nbsp;<i>Brockovich</i>&nbsp;to the redheaded evil Queen in Mirror, Mirror to a brunette in Mona Lisa Smile, Julia has done it all. She has brown hair naturally, and while I think it suits her best (most people look best with what God gave them when it comes to hair color, I think); if it comes down to blonde or red for Julia, I'm Team Red all the way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-jennifer-lawrence><strong>4. Jennifer Lawrence</strong></h2><p>The young actress who got her breakout role in Winter's Bone (where she actually learned to hunt and skin animals!) looks great no matter what color her hair is, and in most of her films she boasts blonde or light brown tresses. But not for her biggest and most famous role, as Katniss Everdeen in the hugely popular sci-fi trilogy The Hunger Games (her co-star Julianne Moore is her nemesis/ally in these films, and is also on this list). Katniss has very dark hair, which is pretty with JLaw's blue eyes. She wows in every circumstance, but when it comes down to it, I prefer the reddish hue over the blonde.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-jayma-mays><strong>3. Jayma Mays</strong></h2><p>She usually plays the kooky friend or sidekick in her movies, but this ginger's supporting roles have seen her through many hair colors, nonetheless. Her trademark has always been her fiery- though at times faded- red hair, and she looks great with it, so great, that I would not even think twice about the blonde. Her movies Paul Blart: Mall Cop, The Smurfs, and Red Eye (alongside Rachel McAdams, also on this list), and her television shows Heroes and The League are only a few of her past projects, almost all of which have her going au naturel with her hair color (though I am sure there were highlights), and for good reason. Blonde does not suit this bombshell!</p><p></p><h2 id=2-emma-stone><strong>2. Emma Stone</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Emma Stone</a>'s breakout role was in Superbad, in which she played love interest Jules, a redhead. Since then, several if not most of her work has been made while a redhead, like The House Bunny, Easy A,&nbsp; and Crazy, Stupid Love. The Amazing&nbsp;<i>Spider Man</i>&nbsp;was one movie where Emma was quite blonde, and she looked pretty, don't get me wrong, but there is just something so much more stunning about her with darker, more vibrant hair. It makes her features pop, and highlights her creamy skin. In Zombieland she had much darker hair, a reddish brown auburn that was also very flattering, but in the end she seems to always go back to the red (as she should, of course).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-amy-adams><strong>1. Amy Adams</strong></h2><p>And we bring it to a close with the lovely <a href=#>Amy Adams</a> (who for the life of me I still cannot tell apart from her lookalike <a href=#>Isla Fisher</a>, except that Isla has seemingly never been blonde, and Amy has). Amy, too, usually plays characters as she already looks, meaning with her own hair color, red. In fact, there are very few films I can find with her as a blonde, or anything besides a redhead. Most directors are smart and utilize her beautiful red hair for their films, like her roles in Junebug, Leap Year, Enchanted, Doubt, American Hustle, and countless others. Light hair is just not flattering with her fair skin tone.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong><a href=#>wikipedia.org</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmppXaeypbTEmpusZaedvG64zqiiZqyVp7%2BqrsueZJqrXZe5sLrDnqpo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amazing-race-contestants-best-social-media.html><span>←</span><span>10 Former Amazing Race Contestants Who Have The Strongest Social Media Game</span></a>
