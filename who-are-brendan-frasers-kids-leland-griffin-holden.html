The couple were married for just over ten years, though they seperated in 2007 before getting officially divorced two years later.</p><p>During their time together, though, Fraser and Smith welcomed three children into the world. Here is a closer look at Brendan Fraser's sons.</p><h2 id=brendan-fraser-39-s-family-life><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Brendan Fraser's Family Life</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Brendan-Fraser-and-Afton-Smith.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brendan Fraser met his ex-wife shortly after moving to Los Angeles. Funnily enough, the couple were first introduced at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a barbecue hosted by none other than fellow actress Winona Ryder</a>. Fraser and Afton Smith found an instant connection, and eventually tied the knot five years later, in September 1998.</p><p>After a marriage of just over a decade, Brendan and Afton officially divorced in 2009. The split was messy and cost the actor a pretty penny when <a href=# rel=nofollow>Smith started discussing child support payments</a>. This was especially stressful as Fraser was not landing as many roles as normal, meaning he was bringing in less money post-divorce. Thankfully all was settled, and the two are now living contented lives -- separate from each other.</p><h2 id=griffin-arthur-fraser-is-brendan-fraser-39-s-oldest-child><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Griffin Arthur Fraser Is Brendan Fraser's Oldest Child</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/brendan-fraser-sons.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Griffin Arthur Fraser is the firstborn of Brendan Fraser and Afton Smith.

In an interview with GQ back in 2018, Brendan said, "<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">He needs extra love in the world</a>, and he gets it." The actor attributes his oldest son as one of the reasons he is such a successful actor, later sharing, "People have some rough edges to them. Or he just makes them, I don’t know…put things into sharper relief and maybe find a way to have a little bit more compassion.
