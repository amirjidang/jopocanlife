Several rappers showed love to Gillie Da Kid and his late son in the comments, namely <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Meek Mill</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Pusha T</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Lola Brooke</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Armani White</a>.

He was reportedly shot in the back and rushed to the hospital where he was officially pronounced dead. A 28-year-old man and a 31-year-old man were also shot and taken to medical facilities and eventually brought to stable condition.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Gillie’s Million Dollaz co-host <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wallo267</a> paid his respects to Cheese on two occasions. “Lil Cuz usually when I talk to you, I got a lot to tell you,” he wrote in a July 21 post featuring a picture of the late rapper. “Tonight the pain in my heart & tears spoke to you. I love you beyond life Cheese. I got your father, Rest Well!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Wallo followed up days later, expressing gratitude for all the love shown to them. While it was a difficult time, he asserted that their goals remain the same. “Please know that, our mission to lift & educate the youngins will continue and become stronger,” he wrote. “No matter what, we’ll never stop believing that tomorrow will be better than yesterday.” Check out Wallo’s posts below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5y2rbjInmSdmV2gtqV5zKisq6ajYrmwv9JmqqimXZ2yor7Tn5ylrF2eu7TAwKCpmqVdZn90gJZwbWttYWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gigi-hadid-clarifies-comments-about-pregnant-rihanna-expecting-twins.html><span>←</span><span>Gigi Hadid Clarifies Comments About Pregnant Rihanna Expecting Twins</span></a>
