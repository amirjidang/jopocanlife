We say this because he has been married five times already. Although Hollywood is not exactly known for its long-lasting relationships (which is why when a marriage lasts more than a decade, it is often celebrated), five marriages are still something that stands out from the norm.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The good news for the actor is that it seems like his last marriage with Riko Shibata is the one that is going to last. And it certainly sets itself apart from his others in many ways. This includes what Cage has said about the coupling and the current length of their relationship.</p><h2 id=who-has-nicolas-cage-been-married-to>Who Has Nicolas Cage Been Married To?</h2><p>Nicolas Cage's first marriage was to Patricia Arquette. The former couple was married from 1995 to 2000. The actor had been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">completely smitten with Arquette</a>, so much so that he is believed to have given her multiple gifts and performed grand gestures to win her affection.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kathleen Turner Won't Ever Work On Another Film With Nicolas Cage Again After Her Experience With The Actor</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She wouldn't come out, but I could see her peeking down from the top floor. In my very showy way, I whipped the orchid out of my pocket. Then I whipped out the paint can and started spray-painting the orchid black. She was freaked out. I rang the doorbell again, and she came down. I just gave it to her and got back on my motorcycle and left," Cage told Playboy (via InStyle). Whatever Cage did, he did something write because InStyle notes that Patricia Arquette actually ended up proposing to Cage.</p><p>Their romance would not last, though, and in 2000, they filed for divorce, citing "irreconcilable differences" (although it has been reported that they actually split earlier in their relationship and waited before filing). The <a href=#>next marriage was to Lisa Marie Presley</a>, who Cage married in 2002 until 2004.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nicolas-cage-and-lisa-marie-presley.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking of their breakup, he told Barbara Walters (according to People) how they could not make it work. "Oftentimes when you have two people who are very strong and their own personalities, and rather intense, sometimes you can have a hard time meshing. We got into this unfortunate pattern of breaking up and getting back together again. Where I came out on it is, yeah, it's sad, I miss her every day. Sometimes I wish we couldn't have rushed the marriage, and sometimes I regret rushing the divorce. But it just seemed like it wasn't going to change."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Nicolas Cage Did This Messed Up Thing With His Cat, And Fans Aren't Happy</a></span></p><p>The third woman to get Cage down the aisle was Alice Kim, and this was the longest time he was married. The pair exchanged vows in 2004 and would divorce in 2016. They remain close (she even attended his fifth wedding). The couple also have a son, Kal-El Coppola.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Three years later, <a href=#>Nicolas Cage married Erika Koike</a>, and this was his shortest marriage, lasting just four days. The couple married in Las Vegas, but the actor would later file for an annulment. As for why this was? According to People, court documents stated Cage "lacked understanding of his actions in marrying [Koike] to the extent that he was incapable of agreeing to the marriage."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nicolas-Cage-Is-Expecting-A-Baby-With-Wife-Who-Is-30-Years-Younger-1.jpg><p>He would later address the breakup in an interview with The New York Times Magazine, although he was reluctant to go into too much detail. "There was a recent breakup," he said at the time. "I don't really want to talk about it. I was pretty upset about that and the way things happened."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His most recent marriage is with Riko Shibata, and the couple married in 2021. In addition to his marriages, Cage has been linked to some of the biggest stars, including Brooke Shields, Lisa Stothard, Christina Fulton (who he shares son Weston Cage with), and Sarah Jessica Parker. He was also engaged to Kristen Zang.</p><h2 id=what-has-nicolas-cage-said-about-marrying-riko-shibata>What Has Nicolas Cage Said About Marrying Riko Shibata?</h2><p>Riko Shibata and Nicolas Cage met in Shiga, Japan. According to People, they were introduced by mutual friends while the actor had been in the country filming Prisoners of the Ghostland. In 2020 the couple got engaged, and they used technology to help them do it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nicolas-cage-and-riko-shibata.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She left New York and went back to Kyoto, Japan, and I went back to Nevada, and I haven't seen her for six months," Cage told Marc Coppola for his radio station in 2020. "We were really happy together, and we were really excited to spend that time together, so I finally just said, 'Look, I wanna marry you,' and we got engaged on FaceTime."</p><p>They would not wait long before getting married and exchanged vows in Las Vegas in 2021. It was not a lavish affair; instead, they chose to keep it simple with a "very small and intimate wedding at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas," their rep told People.</p><h2 id=why-is-nicolas-cage-39-s-relationship-with-riko-shibata-different>Why Is Nicolas Cage's Relationship With Riko Shibata Different?</h2><p>In 2022, the couple celebrated another milestone together: they became parents. According to People, they had a child, August Francesca. "Nicolas and Riko are happy to announce the birth of their daughter," their rep told the publication. "Mother and daughter are doing fine." This was the first child for Shibata <a href=#>but is Cage's third child</a> (with three different baby mamas).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Are Nicolas Cage And Pedro Pascal Friends After Working Together On The Unbearable Weight Of Massive Talent?</a></span></p><p>Cage also feels very strongly about his wife and has admitted in an interview with Los Angeles Times that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he feels this time around is it</a>. "I know five is a lot, but I think I got it right this time," he said. He said similar things in an interview with GQ in 2022.</p><p>"I am a romantic, and when I'm in love, I want to give that person everything I can. It's my expression of saying, 'I love you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.' And this is it for me," he said. "I mean, this is not happening again. This is it. This is it." So, even if their relationship does not end up lasting, what makes it completely different from the other marriages is that Cage has no intention of exchanging vows again. Will Riko Shibata will be his last wife? He hopes so!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiloptdmK6osdJmqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCpZaeewal51qKdnmWinriwedKhoJuZpJZ6pbXFn5yrnZ6perW0wKdkqKyYmr9ugIymmKuqmZa0pr%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-is-briana-latrise-from-growing-up-hip-hop-arrested-father-and-net-worth-2022-218412-html.html><span>←</span><span>Why Is Briana Latrise From Growing Up Hip Hop Arrested?
