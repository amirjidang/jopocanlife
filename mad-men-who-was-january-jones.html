In fact, she's been active in Hollywood since at least 1999, though fans may have overlooked her resume pre-2007, the year she debuted as Betty.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Mad Men' Makes A Return To Streaming: Exploring The Show's Legacy In 2020</a></span></p><p>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the gorgeous actress doesn't seem to age</a>, January Jones is in her 40s now. Though she looks as young as ever, it's worth noting that her first film was actually in 1999. She played a role in 'It's the Rage,' a movie based on a play about how firearms affected each of the characters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maybe it wasn't a critically acclaimed blockbuster, but it was a start for the 20-year-old actress. Plus, films that came after on her resume were more recognizable by today's fans. In 2003, Jones had three films come out that were more widely viewed: 'Anger Management,' 'American Wedding,' and 'Love Actually.'</p><p>Then the next year, she played Eve in 'Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights,' though it was hardly a leading role. Still, the opportunity to be on set with Patrick Swayze probably spurred her decision to accept the minor role.</p><p>January acted in a few other films before nabbing her role on 'Mad Men,' and though the titles may not be as recognizable as other projects, she did get a chance to work with industry greats like Tommy Lee Jones,&nbsp;Leelee Sobieski, Bruce Willis, Cate Blanchett, Billy Bob Thornton, David Duchovny, and even Brad Pitt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though her TV experience at the time was limited to a few pilots and appearances on 'Huff,' January was already rubbing elbows with tons of Hollywood staples when 'Mad Men' landed in her lap.</p><p>Although, it did take&nbsp;a mid-'Mad Men' film for the starlet to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">finally get to work with her childhood crush</a>. The whole cascade of events was a near-miss, though, as January wasn't a shoo-in for the role of Betty from day one.</p><p>In fact, January talked about the experience of auditioning for 'Mad Men' sans the Betty character altogether. In an interview mid-'Mad Men,' when she debuted in 'X-Men: First Class,' January told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">W Magazine</a> that originally, there was "no Betty" in the pilot. She auditioned for Peggy, reading two times, but lost out to Elisabeth Moss.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Undeterred, January heard a "casual mention" that Don Draper was married. Matthew Weiner, who was the creator of the show, immediately penned two scenes featuring Betty, and a few days later January auditioned for the part.</p><p>But it wasn't yet cemented in a contract or even a script at that point. Jones took a chance, and Matt was true to his word that he'd flesh out the character, and Betty took on a life of her own — carrying January through to true, well-deserved stardom.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Jon Hamm & The Mad Men Cast Have Been Up To Since The Show's Finale</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmpxdorKvedahpmavkah6q63NrpirsV2fvK%2Bx0mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-zia-quizon-boyfriend-alexsa-couple-getting-married-after-long-term-relationship-349482-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Zia Quizon Boyfriend Alexsa?
