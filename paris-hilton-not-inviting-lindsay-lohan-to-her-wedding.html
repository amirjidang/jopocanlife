In 2006, Lohan was reportedly dating Greek shipping heir <strong>Stavros Niarchos</strong>, an ex of Hilton’s. And when paparazzi caught up with Hilton and her friend <a href=#><strong>Brandon Davis</strong></a> that May, Davis disparaged Lohan — calling her “poor,” “disgusting,” and a “fire crotch” — as Hilton listened and laughed.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paris-Hilton-Lindsay-Lohan-throwback.jpg><p>That November, Lohan apparently called Hilton the c-word on camera as she left Hollywood’s Roosevelt Hotel, though she immediately denied the name-calling when the photographers questioned her about it.</p><p>Meanwhile, in May 2011, Hilton took a jab at Lohan’s reputation on an episode of the reality show The World According to Paris. As she gave <a href=# data-link=1>earrings</a> to a homeless woman, the woman mistook her for Lohan, and Hilton replied, “If I was Lindsay, I’d be stealing the earrings, not giving them away.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/paris-hilton-and-chris-zylka-wedding.jpg><p>Back in the present day, Hilton did say her friend (and former assistant) <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> would be invited to the wedding — especially after Kardashian <a href=#>helped <strong>Alice Johnson</strong> get out of jail</a>. “I’m so proud of her,” Hilton told TMZ. “I really applaud her.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapmaKewG60yKWrqKZdo7y1ecinraKsmaO0brjIp5usmaliubC0wKdkraddnbKzedaem52hnpx8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicolette-scorsese-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Nicolette Scorsese Net Worth How Much is Nicolette Scorsese Worth?</span></a>
