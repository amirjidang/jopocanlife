During the lead-up to AEW All Out 2019, it was rumored that the wrestler, who left WWE in 2014, might make an appearance since the show was going to be in Chicago, Punk’s hometown. Unfortunately, that never panned out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/VWTF3XIGCZCOZHP4YU6TJQ44OU.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is still a possibility that one of wrestling’s most beloved stars might be open to an offer from AEW. In interviews, Punk has said that he might consider a return if the storyline were interesting and the money right. Although recruiting the Nineteenth Triple Crown Champion might be expensive, it would certainly pay off. Considering AEW recently signed retired <a href=#>WWE Hall of Famer Sting</a>, an appearance from Punk would not be unthinkable.</p><p>On November 12, 2019, Punk made a surprise appearance on the Fox Sports 1 series WWE Backstage. He subsequently joined the program as a special contributor and analyst. Punk reportedly accepted the position because he would be under contract with Fox rather than WWE.</p><p>As for an in-ring return, Punk said at the time that he was not interested but also not opposed to the idea, stating it was "a bridge that is gonna have to be built". Unfortunately, production of WWE Backstage was put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic and later suspended by Fox in June 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Source: <a href=#>Essentially Sports</a></p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Former WWE Star Mike Knox Didn't Think CM Punk Was That Good" href=#>Former WWE Star Mike Knox Didn't Think CM Punk Was That Good</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeemsS0e8OrZJuqmanBbq7ApJyrZZmjw6rAxKxknKVdpcKvt4ytpmaZlax8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-michael-frank-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-582262-html.html><span>←</span><span>David Michael Frank Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
