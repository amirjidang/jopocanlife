There's nothing quite like settling down in the evening to&nbsp;enjoy a certified classic and reminisce about good times.

But this is certainly an unfair stereotype: tragedy is not the default or inevitable outcome for all child actors and many have enjoyed prosperous careers outside the industry. From Christmas favorites to emotional dramas, here's what happened to the kids in these classic movies.</p><h2 id=justin-cooper---liar-liar><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Justin Cooper - 'Liar, Liar'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Liar, Liar</a>&nbsp;remains one of Jim Carrey's most popular comedies. At the heart of the movie lies the relationship between Fletcher (Carrey) and his young son Max, played by Justin Cooper, who was 9-years-old at the time. Cooper stopped acting a year after the movie's release and now enjoys a successful career as a producer for Fox Sports Radio.</p><h2 id=lisa-jakub---mrs-doubtfire><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Lisa Jakub - 'Mrs. Doubtfire'</span></h2><p>While&nbsp;Mrs Doubtfire's&nbsp;youngest actor, Mara Wilson, went on to star in hits&nbsp;Matilda&nbsp;and&nbsp;Miracle on 34th Street&nbsp;and has made numerous media appearances as an adult, we rarely hear about her on-screen sister.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Facts About Some Of Robin Williams' Most Beloved Films</a></span></p><p>Lisa Jakub, who played her older sister, went on to appear in&nbsp;Independence Day&nbsp;as Randy Quaid's daughter, but retired from acting in 2001.
