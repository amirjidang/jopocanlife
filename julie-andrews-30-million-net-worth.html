The removal was botched, however, leaving her voice permanently damaged. In 1999, she took on the doctors who had performed the procedure, suing for malpractice which has robbed her of her livelihood and caused intense emotional anguish. She settled for an undisclosed amount, and has spoken little on the subject since.</p><h2 id=julie-andrews-has-made-an-art-out-of-diversifying><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Julie Andrews Has Made An Art Out Of Diversifying</span></h2><p>Andrews was devastated by the results of unsuccessful surgery on her vocal cords back in 1997 which left her unable to sing and perform as she previously had. Despite this terrible setback, however, the actress has found new means of artistic expression, and in recent years has entered into a variety of new ventures. She is author of a successful series of children’s books, and has also worked on Julie’s Greenroom, a Netflix show featuring ‘Ms Julie’ and a host of colorful puppets which has been a huge success on the platform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her voice has also been heard on Bridgerton, where she performs as the narrator, Lady Whistledown.
