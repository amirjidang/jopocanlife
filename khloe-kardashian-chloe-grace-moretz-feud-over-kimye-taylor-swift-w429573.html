(Hear Taylor and Kanye West’s controversial conversation that launched the Internet firestorm in the video above!)</span></p><p>The drama came to a head on Sunday, July 17, when the <i>Selfish</i> author, 35, took to Snapchat to release husband <b>Kanye West</b>’s phone call with Swift, 26, in which the pop superstar seemingly signs off on Yeezy, 39, using her name in his controversial song “Famous.” As fans know, the hip-hop magnate raps, “I feel like me and Taylor still might have sex / Why? I made that bitch famous.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/khloe-kardashian-vs-chloe-moretz-square-916dd091-54c0-4c87-ae20-a791ae743c35.jpg><p>In response to Kim’s series of snaps — which were posted to call out Swift for apparently lying about not knowing about West’s lyric — <a href=#>19-year-old Moretz wrote</a>: “Stop wasting your voice on something so petulant and unimportant. Everyone in this industry needs to get their heads out of a hole and look around to realize what’s ACTUALLY happening in the REAL world.”</p><p>Defending her older sister, Khloé, 32, clapped back by posting <a href=#>a side-by-side collage of Moretz</a> in a red bikini next to an explicit photo of a woman in a nearly identical swimsuit who resembled the <i>Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising</i> star. “Is this the a hole you’re referring to @ChloeGMoretz ???” the <i>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</i> personality sniped.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/khloe-kardashian-tweets-about-chloe-moretz-64046c51-afe3-4974-8be6-e228d4c0e67f.jpg><p>Moretz — who beefed with the Kardashian clan back in March when the <i>If I Stay</i> actress criticized Kim for posting an internet-breaking nude selfie — stood up for herself by tweeting, “@khloekardashian fact check: first photo is me filming my movie <i>Neighbors 2,</i> the second photo is some girl who was wrongfully photographed.”</p><p>As previously reported, Kim told <i>GQ</i> that Swift, 26, was well aware of West’s eyebrow-raising track and revealed that she had a recording of the two musicians’ phone call to prove it. But according to Swift’s rep, the pop star was unaware of West’s mention in “Famous” until the single premiered during a <i>Life of Pablo</i> listening party back in February.</p><span class=caption></span><p>“Kanye did not call for approval, but to ask Taylor to release his single ‘Famous’ on her Twitter account,” Swift’s publicist said in a statement following the tune’s release. “She declined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message.”</p><p>Despite Swift’s rep’s statement, the conversation between the “Blank Space” singer and Ye played out a bit differently, according to Kim’s Snapchats.</p><p>“What I give a f–k about is just you as a person and as a friend,” West told Swift, before she encouraged him to “go with whatever line … [you think is] better.”</p><p>“I really appreciate you telling me about it, that’s really nice,” she can be heard telling West. “Even asking or seeing if I’d be OK with it. I just really appreciate it. I would never have expected you to tell me about one of the lines in your song.”</p><p>Swift also told West that she would plan on telling the press that he called her and they were all good. “If people ask me about it, I think it would be great for me to be like, ‘Look, he called me and told me the line before it came out. Joke’s on you, guys. We’re fine!’”</p><p>Swift responded to Kim’s brutal takedown by sharing a lengthy note via Instagram.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BH_TCz4DeSj/</p><p>“Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me ‘that bitch’ in his song? It doesn’t exist because it never happened. You don’t get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world. Of course I wanted to like the song. I wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for me, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot ‘approve’ a song you haven’t heard,” her statement read. “Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination. I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoJyksm63wKubmquYnq6vecKho6idXZy%2Foq%2FEZqSoqpWpx26yxK6bZqemmr9ut8imsJ5lpJbGrbvRZqqwoZaperiAkXJscGtf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kathy-ambush-clarence-thomas-ex-wife-wiki-bio-age-height-weight-married-husband-facts.html><span>←</span><span>Kathy Ambush (Clarence Thomas Ex-Wife) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Married, Husband, Facts</span></a>
