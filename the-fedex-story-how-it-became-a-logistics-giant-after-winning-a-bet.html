Founded in 1971 by Frederick W. Smith, the company has become a global leader in the logistics industry, <a href=#>delivering millions of packages daily to customers worldwide</a>. The journey to success, however, was challenging. At one point, the company's existence hung in the balance, with its fate determined by a <a href=#>single night at a Las Vegas</a> casino. And what happened later is history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>FedEx is currently spread out worldwide with the largest cargo aircraft fleet. It delivers over 1.2 Billion packages annually in more than 220 countries while clocking in an annual revenue of over $40 Billion.</p><h2 id=frederick-w-smith-and-the-birth-of-fedex>Frederick W. Smith And The Birth Of FedEx</h2><p>Frederick W. Smith, the founder of FedEx, was born in 1944 in Marks, Mississippi. He <a href=#>attended the prestigious Yale University</a>, where he studied economics and wrote a term paper that would later serve as the foundation for his groundbreaking business idea. In the paper, Smith proposed a new system for overnight delivery of time-sensitive goods, which he believed could revolutionize the logistics industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Rare Beauty Empire: Here's How Selena Gomez Built Her Beauty Brand</a></span></p><p>After serving as a Marine Corps officer in the Vietnam War, Smith returned to the United States and decided to turn his vision into reality. In 1971, he founded Federal Express Corporation, which would later become FedEx, as per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brand Riddle</a>. The company's initial operations were modest, with a small fleet of aircraft and a handful of employees. However, Smith's innovative approach to logistics, which focused on a centralized hub-and-spoke system, allowed FedEx to expand its services and customer base rapidly.</p><h2 id=a-high-stakes-gamble-that-saved-the-company>A High-Stakes Gamble That Saved&nbsp;The Company</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the early years of FedEx, the company faced significant financial challenges. By 1974, the company was on the verge of bankruptcy, with mounting debts and dwindling cash reserves. Smith had already invested much of his fortune into the business, and additional funding from investors seemed unlikely.</p><p>In a desperate bid to save the company, Smith took a gamble, quite literally. He flew to Las Vegas with the company's last $5,000 and played blackjack at a casino. Miraculously, Smith turned the $5,000 into $27,000, just enough to cover the company's fuel bill for the following week, as mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>.</p><p>This daring move bought FedEx some much-needed time, allowing the company to secure additional funding and continue its operations. The casino incident would later become a legendary tale in the annals of business history, symbolizing the entrepreneurial spirit and risk-taking defining FedEx.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the gamble paid off, there needed to be a more sustainable solution to the company's financial woes. Smith knew he needed to secure additional funding to keep the business alive. In 1974, he raised $11 million in equity financing, allowing FedEx to expand its operations and begin turning a profit.</p><h2 id=becoming-a-global-leader-in-logistics>Becoming A Global Leader In Logistics</h2><p>Since its near-collapse in the 1970s, FedEx has grown exponentially, becoming a global leader in the logistics industry. By 1976, FedEx was handling over 19,000 packages per day, and by 1980, the company had reached $1 billion in annual revenues. Today, FedEx is a global powerhouse, with operations in more than 220 countries and territories. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, it operates a fleet of over 650 aircraft and employs more than 600,000 people worldwide. <a href=#>FedEx's innovative approach to logistics</a>, which Smith first conceived in his college term paper, has allowed the company to maintain a competitive edge in a rapidly evolving industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>FedEx's success can be attributed to its unwavering commitment to customer service and ability to adapt to changing market conditions. The company has continually invested in new technologies and infrastructure, ensuring it remains at the forefront of the logistics industry. In recent years, FedEx has also made significant strides in sustainability, implementing measures to reduce its environmental impact and promote responsible business practices. FedEx aims to achieve carbon-neutral operations by 2040, 10 years earlier than the timeline laid out by the Paris Climate Agreement, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sustainability Magazine</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The story of FedEx is a testament to the power of innovation, perseverance, and calculated risk-taking. From its humble beginnings as a small startup founded by a visionary entrepreneur, the company has become a global powerhouse in the logistics industry. The legendary casino incident serves as a reminder of the importance of taking bold risks in pursuing success and the incredible impact that a single decision can have on a company's history. As FedEx continues to evolve and adapt to the challenges of the 21st century, its remarkable journey inspires entrepreneurs and business leaders worldwide.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's How Nestlé Became A Giant In The Food Industry</a></span></p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sustainability Magazine</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brand Riddle</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMn5ydnahiwLW70bJkoaenYra1ecGempqllWKubrjOoKCsrJmYwG6zyJqlrWWRm8GmvoywoKemmaO0bq2Mm5ytZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-cast-of-bravos-million-dollar-listing-ranked-by-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>The Cast Of Bravo's 'Million Dollar Listing' Ranked By Net Worth</span></a>
