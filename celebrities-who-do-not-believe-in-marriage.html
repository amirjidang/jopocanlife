From being focused on work to experiencing a bad marriage, there are many reasons why marriage has taken the back seat today. Celebrities are not far behind in having their opinions straight and <a href=#>direct about never wanting to get married</a>. Many celebrities have been in long-term relationships for decades but enjoy the way things are, while others are scared of what the future holds or prefer not to repeat the mistakes from the past. From Oprah Winfrey’s 36-year relationship to <a href=#>Drew Barrymore’s apprehension as a single mother</a>, let’s look at the celebrities who say they are never getting married.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=oprah-winfrey><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Oprah Winfrey</span></h2><p>Oprah Winfrey has been dating Stedman Graham since her show debuted on television in 1986. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Graham proposed to Winfrey, and the pair even got engaged in 1993</a>. After she had doubts about marriage, they called it off. The couple later confessed that the marriage and day-to-day commitment wouldn’t have worked out if they had married.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Oprah Winfrey Has Said About Not Having Kids</a></span></p><h2 id=winona-ryder><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Winona Ryder</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Winona Ryder is a daughter to a set of happily married parents whose marriage has lasted over 40 years. The actress believes they have set a high precedent in her life that remains unattainable. Ryder has been in a relationship with Scott Mackinlay since 2011 but prefers to remain single rather than get a few divorces.</p><h2 id=allison-janney><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Allison Janney</span></h2><p><a href=#>Allison Janney</a> last dated Richard Jenik before they split in 2006.

The comedian has stated that they are happily unmarried and wouldn’t change a thing about their relationship. They met in high school and have been together for 40 years. His anti-marital stance remains the same for many years, and he finds marriage a pointless concept.</p><h2 id=kris-jenner><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kris Jenner</span></h2><p>Kris Jenner has been the family matriarch of the Kardashian-Jenner clan since her marriage to Robert Kardashian in 1997. After their divorce, she married Caitlyn Jenner, formerly known as Bruce, before they separated. She has been in a committed relationship with Corey Gamble since 2014 but does not feel the need to wear a wedding dress and walk down the aisle again. She feels blessed with her past experiences but wouldn’t want a wedding again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=susan-sarandon><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Susan Sarandon</span></h2><p>Unlike celebrities who never want to get married, Susan Sarandon did tie the knot in 1967 when she was in high school.
