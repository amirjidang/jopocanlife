But when a breakup song works, it works.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is unquestionably the case with Fletcher's "Becky's So Hot", which caused an uproar on TikTok in the summer of 2022. Fans immediately took to the song and did their research into the up-and-coming artists' romantic past. Through some sleuthing, they found Fletcher's ex-girlfriend, Shannon Beveridge (of Youtube fame), and her new girlfriend, Becky Missal.</p><p>Fletcher's 2020 visual album was also inspired by her four-year relationship with Shannon. All of this has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">caused fans to wonder about the ethics of Fletcher's songs.</a> After all, she doesn't make much effort to change the names. But perhaps this has added to her appeal.</p><p>In a recent interview, Fletcher admitted that she almost didn't release the song. Here's why she changed her mind as well as why she feels everyone connected with it...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-fletcher-get-famous>How Did Fletcher Get Famous?</h2><p>Prior to having her big breakout success, Fletcher actually started out as a competitor on X Factor. She was 17 at the time. And while she had talent, the judges placed her in a group as they didn't think she was strong enough. This is a feeling Fletcher herself felt.</p><p>"I didn’t really believe in myself at the time, so it just made sense for me to be part of a group," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fletcher admitted in an interview with Vulture</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Fletcher is current 28 years old, as she was born in March 1994.</strong></li><li><strong>Fletcher's real name is Cari Fletcher.</strong></li></ul><p>"I think there’s this inner voice that’s always itching and scratching at you from the inside, and over the years I’ve learned to start trusting it and listening to it. That’s when I started writing about my feelings, and put out my first song ever."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Stars Appeared In Music Videos Before They Were Famous</a></span></p><p>This song was "War Paint". The single went viral in 2015 and set her up for success... It just took a while.</p><p>Following "War Paint", the New Jersey-born singer debuted on the Billboard pop charts in 2019 with "Undrunk". The song was off her EP, "You Ruined New York City For Me".</p><p>"I got this response from people who resonated with it and it’s just been me going off of that since. People want to feel connected, and loved, and seen, and heard, and if I can do that with my music, then that’s what success feels like to me," Fletcher said to Vulture.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Harshest Celebrity Breakup Songs Ever Written</a></span></p><p>Fans' connection to her music ultimately paved the way for her TikTok takeover. Prior to releasing her debut album, " Girl Of My Dreams", Fletcher made waves on TikTok with her single "Becky's So Hot".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The pop-punk hit harkened back to <a href=#>the works of Fefe Dobson</a> or Avril Lavinge, but for a completely new era.</p><p>Fans were also entranced by the subject of the single, which isn't something Fletcher herself endorses. But she is thrilled that their love of the single has opened the door for "Girl Of My Dreams" to be successful.</p><p>"Girl of My Dreams is just the cherry on top, the culmination of everything that’s happened since day one."</p><h2 id=fletcher-wasn-39-t-going-to-release-quot-becky-39-s-so-hot-quot>Fletcher Wasn't Going To Release "Becky's So Hot"</h2><p>As soon as a snippet of "Becky's So Hot" debuted on TikTok in July 2022, the internet went crazy. While it caused controversy, it certainly made Fletcher more popular. But there was a time when she wasn't going to include the song on her album or even release it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When I was putting together the album, “Becky’s So Hot” felt like a piece that was missing from the story," Fletcher explained to Vulture as to why she changed her mind. "That song sort of existed outside of the way that I usually write. I happened to be in the studio writing something else, and I was creeping on my ex’s new girlfriend. She had posted a picture wearing an old vintage T-shirt that I’d worn before, and I accidentally liked the photo."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything Aly And AJ Have Done Since "Potential Breakup Song"</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fletcher went on to admit, "She looked so hot that I was like, How can I even be mad? I was interested in exploring those nuanced, complex feelings that a lot of people think they shouldn’t talk about. I just thought, if I felt this way, why should I censor it? It’s an honest part of the journey, just like, F*** this, but she’s hot. Being radically honest, it doesn’t bring out the prettiest emotions, but I’ve never been one to shy away from ugly feelings or edit the narrative. I’m here for those things, and that’s why it’s on my album."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidpZ2kmLWmvoybnJyjqah6tLuMoaatZaSeuLW7ymadmqWVYrK5ecaiqaWeop6yr7CO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fans-are-shocked-by-jeremy-renners-music-career-heres-why.html><span>←</span><span>Fans Are Shocked By Jeremy Renner's Music Career, Here's Why</span></a>
