The 14-year-old Karate Kid star sat down with <strong>The Life Files</strong> and talked about his current projects, his fashion line “Msfts” and the most important piece of advice from his superstar dad, Will. <strong>On His Fashion Choices</strong> I have this image in my head of what I think an amazing fashion person would look like, and I really just take whatever I would want to wear and I just put it on. Sometimes you get criticized for it, [but] give it two months and everybody’s wearing it. I just really like that skater look — wake up in the morning and throw some clothes on still looking fly, you know what I mean? I get a lot of my fashion just from things that I see, inspiration just comes in and out in the day. I don’t think that I’m a fashion guru or anything. I just put on stuff to go skate. Sometimes people like it, sometimes they don’t. [Points to his clothes] These are just random skate shoes…. And a top shop [jacket] and a Msfts tee and pants. That’s my company that I make. It’s basically just like a skate lifestyle company. I basically wear the same thing everyday. <strong>On Whether He Watches Reality TV</strong> I watch like, Steve Jobs interviews, I don’t really watch TV. I stopped watching TV when I turned like ten because my parents were like, ‘TV’s really bad for you.’ I’ll watch movies I like to see, Steve Jobs interviews, something that’s going to make me smart and then go to sleep. I always have to go to sleep with the TV on though. I’m always watching something, I just don’t like watching TV. I don’t like being sold something every five minutes a commercial comes up.[…]We have iPhones now. If I want to see [what my family has] coming up I [would just] Google it. <strong>On Working on ‘The Pursuit of Happyness’ With His Dad</strong> It was pretty cool, you know. We were working together and it was fun until we get into a scene and we were both very serious about it but it was cool. It was fun having that experience with my dad ’cause he really taught me a lot of the stuff that he knows. Almost everything he knows about acting in that one movie. <strong>On The Best Advice His Dad Has Ever Given Him</strong> My dad one time told me, he was like, ‘The only time you should lie is when someone’s holding a gun to your head and says ‘Okay, lie or I’m going to shoot you.’ And that really stuck with me. I think about that a lot. I used to not be really honest with girls and then I dropped a song called “Starry Room” and then I started turning over a new leaf. Now, I’m completely honest with girls all the time and they just get mad at me. Check out the rest of the interview <a href=# rel=nofollow>here</a>. Jaden’s debut mixtape The Cool Café: The Cool Tape Vol. 1 will be available for download on Sept. 31. We here at VIBE are excited to see what else Lil Will has to offer. “Starry Room” <code><span class=embed-youtube></span></code></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2BupbHNZqqmoaSderWty6SqZqCZqHqkuM6tn6Kml2K5qrrEZpinnF2Wsbe1wp5kn6qfonqjtcZmrqKknGJ%2Bcn6Ybmdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-a-texas-sheriff-arrested-for-hanging-cartel-members-fake-news-debunked-360285-html.html><span>←</span><span>Is A Texas Sheriff Arrested For Hanging Cartel Members?
