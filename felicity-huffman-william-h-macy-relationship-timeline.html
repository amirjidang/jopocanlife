I don’t think <a href=#>there is a secret</a>,” Macy told Us Weekly of his marriage in September 2017. “But mostly, I’m lucky. I met her, she said yes, we grew up in the theater together, we have shared interests, and she’s a good woman to her core and evolving always. And no one has ever seen me the way she sees me.”</p><p>The actors even work well together. “Don’t try this at home, kids. This is not a good idea,” he said. “We talk the talk and walk the walk. I read her scripts, she reads mine, we give each other notes, we run lines with each other, we’re in it. It’s dangerous territory, but if you’re married well, you can get through it.”</p><p>Huffman echoed her husband’s statements when she caught up with&nbsp;Us&nbsp;in April 2018. “I lucked out, I married Bill Macy,” she admitted. “But that’s as far as I can go. I don’t know how you make marriage work, <a href=#>I just got lucky</a>. I have no idea.”</p><p>The&nbsp;Fargo&nbsp;star stayed by his wife’s side when she was arrested in March 2019 for <a href=#>her alleged involvement in a college admissions scam</a>. “To all the moms out there, you’re all superheroes and you’re all <a href=#>good enough</a>,” the actress wrote via Instagram days before the scandal broke. “Don’t let anyone tell you differently.”</p><p>Huffman pleaded guilty to charges of fraud in May 2019. She <a href=#>served 11 days in prison</a> in October 2019 and <a href=#>completed her full sentence</a> in October 2020.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Macy advocated on her behalf in a <a href=#>letter to the judge ahead of her sentencing</a>, writing, “If I may I’d like to tell you one more thing: every good thing in my life is because of Felicity Huffman.”</p><p>Scroll to relive Macy and Huffman’s decades-long relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNks6a4yJygrbFdncKnssyapWavmaG5qq3MZp9mpZGYxm6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mq6KllaG2r7GO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fans-are-deeply-uncomfortable-about-paul-walkers-relationship-with-jasmine-pilchardgosnell-heres-why.html><span>←</span><span>Fans Are Deeply Uncomfortable About Paul Walker's Relationship With Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell, Here's</span></a>
