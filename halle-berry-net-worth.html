But how exactly did Oscar-winning actress Halle Berry earn all that cash, and what's she doing with it these days?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> confirms that Halle's net worth totals between 80 and 90&nbsp;million dollars as of 2020. That's due in part to a high per-movie salary. But acting isn't Halle's only gig.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Fans Think Halle Berry Is One Of The Most Humble Celebs</a></span></p><p>Since 1996, Halle's been contracted as one of the faces of Revlon, notes&nbsp;Celebrity Net Worth. That deal earns her around $10 million per year, though multiple sources say she asked for a raise after her Oscar win (who knows what the amount was before that!). And her first "major paycheck" from film arrived back in 1996, too, when she earned $1 million in 'Executive Decision.'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Halle did take a bit of a pay cut for 'Monster's Ball,' though, at a meager $600,000 for the entire film.</p><p>If that wasn't enough to pad her pockets, Halle also earned a hefty payday for plenty of movies like 'Swordfish,' which netted the actress $2.5 million. Then, she became a Bond girl in 'Die Another Day' to the tune of $4 million. Plus, she starred in 'Gothika' for a pretty $6 million.</p><p>However, 'Catwoman' was a turning point for Berry. As&nbsp;Celebrity Net Worth points out, Halle was one of the highest-paid actresses in the world throughout the 2000s.</p><p>Though the movie wasn't the most critically acclaimed film of her career, it did <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">earn Halle Berry quite a bit of cash</a>. The payday for that movie was the equivalent of $19 million today (sources can't agree whether it was $12.5 or $14 million the star earned back in the early 2000s).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also graced the small screen in 'Extant,' which reportedly earned Halle $100,000 per episode. The show ended after two seasons, however, though Halle wasn't out of work for long afterward!</p><p>After all, following 'Catwoman,' Halle's paychecks increased, consistently clocking in at over $10 million per film. Plus, she's been acting and directing her own films (like 2020's 'Bruised'), which no doubt is adding to both her resume and bank account balance.</p><p>Of course, she has sort of been chipping away at it, following the dissolution of at least one of her relationships.</p><p>Yes, fans know that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Halle's romantic relationships</a>&nbsp;haven't always ended amicably. In 2014, a judge ordered Berry to pay $16K per month in child support to her ex-boyfriend, Gabriel Aubry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's almost $200,000 per year, and Halle was on the hook for&nbsp;Nahla's school tuition as well.</p><p>Still, Halle's been frugal over the years, so she probably has a healthy savings set aside just in case Hollywood stops sending millions her way.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Reason Why Halle Berry Regrets Her Oscar Win</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifmqScmnqjsdGrsGamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./olivia-wilde-and-harry-styles-relationship-break-up-reasons.html><span>←</span><span>There Was Something Not Quite Right Between Olivia Wilde And Harry Styles From The Start</span></a>
