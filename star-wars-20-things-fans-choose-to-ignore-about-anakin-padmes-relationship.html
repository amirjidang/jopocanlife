He seems to blame her for allowing it to happen, even though he’s the one that leans in. Are we missing something here?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=padm-s-declaration-of-love-doesn-t-quite-add-up><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Padmé’s Declaration Of Love Doesn’t Quite Add Up</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/youtube-1.jpg><p>Padmé confesses her love for Anakin just before the two of them are carted into the Petranki arena, saying it has been there since the beginning. That’s all very romantic, but before that, when the two are preparing to leave Coruscant for Naboo, Padmé tells him to stop looking at her with love eyes because it makes her uncomfortable. It doesn’t seem like love to us!</p><h2 id=anakin-should-have-just-left-the-jedi-to-be-with-padm><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Anakin Should Have Just Left The Jedi To Be With Padmé</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wookieepedia-Fandom-2.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Forbidden love is all the rage in the franchise, but if Anakin really wanted to, he could have left the Jedi Order to be with Padmé. He might be the chosen one, but if he did decide to give it all up to be with Padmé, things would have been a lot better for a lot of people in the long run.</p><h2 id=anakin-doesn-t-respect-padm-s-authority><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Anakin Doesn’t Respect Padmé’s Authority</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Quirk-Books.jpg><p>It’s hard to vouch for these two as a couple when Anakin can’t even pass relationship 101 and respect his partner. When the two visit Naboo and Padmé discusses where to hide with the current Queen, Padmé throws a tantrum and challenges her authority. Even if Padmé did hurt his feelings, he should have more respect for her than that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-don-t-age-at-the-same-rate><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>They Don’t Age At The Same Rate</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wookieepedia-Fandom.jpg><p>One of the major red flags to the relationship between Anakin and Padmé is the fact that they don’t age at the same rate. In the ten years that Anakin spends away from her after meeting her, he transforms from boy to man. In the same amount of time, Padmé barely looks any different.</p><h2 id=the-jedi-council-should-have-found-them-out-sooner><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>The Jedi Council Should Have Found Them Out Sooner</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/TG.jpg><p>When you think about it, the Jedi Council should have discovered Anakin and Padmé’s relationship sooner than they did. The Council is able to sense a lot, including Anakin’s fear when he’s evaluated for the first time. It seems strange that they can’t tell that something is going on between Padmé and Anakin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=especially-since-they-enjoyed-some-pda><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Especially Since They Enjoyed Some PDA</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/We-Heart-It-1.jpg><p>It’s imperative for Padmé and Anakin to keep their relationship a secret, but still, they’re not afraid of some PDA every now and then. In the Senate rotunda after Anakin rescues Chancellor Palpatine, the two hug and kiss, even though there is a group of politicians nearby who could easily catch them.</p><h2 id=padm-s-broken-heart-is-what-did-her-in><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Padmé’s Broken Heart Is What Did Her In</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Padme-Funeral-Revenge-of-the-Sith.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“She’s lost the will to live” is ultimately given as the reason for Padmé’s death. In other words, her broken heart over Anakin does her in. Many fans have had trouble accepting this, especially since at the time Padmé has a new family on the way, which she should be excited about.</p><h2 id=anakin-is-probably-too-obsessed><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Anakin Is Probably Too Obsessed</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Anakin-crying-in-Revenge-of-the-Sith.jpg><p>Anakin develops a crush on Padmé when the two first meet in The Phantom Menace when he’s nine years old and she’s fourteen. He doesn’t see her again for the next ten years, but somehow, he grows more in love with her. If that happened in the real world, we’d call it obsessive, to say the least.</p><h2 id=anakin-gets-physical-with-padm><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Anakin Gets Physical With Padmé</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Inverse-1.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Anakin suspects that Padmé is plotting with the Jedi Council and Obi-Wan, he gets physical with her on Mustafar. This wouldn’t be okay in the real world, and it’s not okay here. It’s also odd given the main reason for Anakin turning is to prevent Padmé from passing over.</p><h2 id=they-probably-should-have-avoided-the-pregnancy><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>They Probably Should Have Avoided The Pregnancy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Inverse-1.jpg><p>There’s already a heap of tension surrounding this relationship before they get pregnant. You’d think that since Padmé and Anakin aren’t allowed to be together, they’d be extra careful about avoiding the possibility of getting pregnant. We’re not sure what the preventative measures are in this universe, but they need to be updated!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-anakin-should-have-ensured-she-had-access-to-better-obstetrics><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>And Anakin Should Have Ensured She Had Access To Better Obstetrics</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Fanpop-2.jpg><p>It’s hard to believe that Padmé has no access to obstetrics care. Particularly as a queen, she should be given the best healthcare available. Even if the couple doesn’t want people knowing about the pregnancy, they could have organized a personal medi-droid. This is especially true considering the fact that Anakin is super talented at programming and the like.</p><h2 id=anakin-doesn-t-want-to-open-up-to-her><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Anakin Doesn’t Want To Open Up To Her</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Jedi-Council-Forums-TheForce.net_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though Anakin loves Padmé, he&nbsp;is constantly closed off from her and refuses to let her into his mind. He never shares his feelings, even though she’s always begging him to open up. Anakin claims that the trouble in his head comes from not being with Padmé, but nothing changes once he has her.</p><h2 id=padm-becomes-a-damsel-in-distress><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Padmé Becomes A Damsel In Distress</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Inverse-2.jpg><p>One of the most disappointing elements to Padmé’s character is that she goes from a powerful female boss-type character to a simple damsel in distress. In the first two movies, she holds her own in the Senate, and on the front lines. But in Revenge of the Sith, Padmé is suddenly helpless and loses the will to live. Clearly, Anakin isn’t good for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=there-s-a-weird-maternal-edge-to-their-relationship><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>There’s A Weird Maternal Edge To Their Relationship</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wookieepedia-Fandom-1.jpg><p>Despite the claims that it was love at first sight, it’s hard to see Padmé and Anakin as a romantic couple when they first meet, because she looks so much older. Because of this, there’s a maternal edge to their relationship that never quite goes away. It doesn’t help when Padmé tells Anakin that he will always be a little boy in her eyes.</p><h2 id=padm-seems-to-find-anakin-s-sand-comment-romantic><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Padmé Seems To Find Anakin’s Sand Comment Romantic</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Starwarz.com_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anakin describes sand by saying, “It’s coarse, it’s rough, it’s irritating … and it gets everywhere!” There’s nothing remotely charming about this, and yet, Padmé still seems to be impressed. Right after he says it, she lays one on him. Like other areas of their relationship, there’s no logic here.</p><h2 id=they-have-majorly-different-values-and-shouldn-t-be-a-couple><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>They Have Majorly Different Values And Shouldn’t Be A Couple</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MovieGuy.com_.jpg><p>Couples can disagree on things, but they should share the same values and morals if they’re going to work together in the long run. Unfortunately, Padmé and Anakin have quite different morals. Anakin believes that the galaxy should be run by a dictatorship, while Padmé obviously disagrees. This should be a strong red flag that they don’t belong together.</p><h2 id=padm-completely-overlooks-anakin-s-crimes><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Padmé Completely Overlooks Anakin’s Crimes</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CBR.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s not uncommon for people to let their partners get away with certain things, but Padmé and Anakin take this too far. As Anakin displays increasingly alarming behavior, Padmé looks the other way. This is especially confusing because she’s supposed to be an intelligent and deeply good character who should pick up on warning signs like that.</p><h2 id=anakin-should-be-able-to-sense-her-big-news><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Anakin Should Be Able To Sense Her Big News</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pinterest-7.jpg><p>When Anakin and Padmé finally reunite after spending months away from each other, he doesn’t sense that she’s pregnant. He’s surprised when she tells him and is rendered speechless with shock. But even if she’s not showing yet, it seems odd that he doesn’t sense that she’s pregnant via the Force.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-he-should-have-been-able-to-sense-two-heartbeats><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>And He Should Have Been Able To Sense Two Heartbeats</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/The-Gamer.jpg><p>It’s a surprise to Anakin when Padmé reveals she’s pregnant, but this isn’t the only thing he should have been able to sense via the force. He should also be able to sense the fact that she’s not pregnant with one baby, but two. The Force has been used to sense life forms in the past, so it doesn’t make much sense that he can’t use it now.</p><p>References: ScreenRant, CBR</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrZmiYsSivtJmaWllpJ22r7PSZp2apqNisKm7zqycZqyfYraous6rnGaZkqTCtXnAp5ikoZ5ivaKwzJ6qZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./20-female-celebs-who-think-theyre-much-smarter-than-they-actually-are.html><span>←</span><span>20 Female Celebs Who Think They're Much Smarter Than They Actually Are</span></a>
