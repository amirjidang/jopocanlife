When he finally takes my blindfold off, we’re standing at the Bulls practice facility, center court. … [We were] pretty much having sex all over the damn place — in the physical therapy room, in the weight room. Obviously on the court.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Brady and Davidson had, ahem, penis on the brain in 2020. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers publicly complimented his longtime teammate <strong>Rob Gronkowski</strong>’s manhood after catching a glimpse in the locker room, while the Saturday Night Live star responded to his ex-fiancée <a href=#><strong>Ariana Grande</strong></a>’s viral 2018 tweet implying that he was <a href=#>“10 inches” long</a> below the belt.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“She has very little hands,” Davidson <a href=#>said of the 5-foot Grammy winner</a> in his Netflix special, Alive From New York, which premiered in February. “Everything is f–king huge to her.”</p><p>Scroll down to see more of 2020’s TMI confessions from stars including <a href=#><strong>Nikki Bella</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Paul Rudd</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong></a>!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksKa4xJupoqyZmsBuw8eoZKygkaeypXnTpqBmoZ5if3F%2Bj2aamqqdmrtuscuemq2qkWLBsLmMm6manKliurC%2BxGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrities-that-live-in-santa-barbara.html><span>←</span><span>Celebrities That Live in Santa Barbara</span></a>
