Acting like a whiny dude in the middle of a tackle football game was new to her, but Betty actually really enjoyed it. Here's why.</p><h2 id=who-could-say-no-to-a-snickers-bar>Who Could Say No To A Snickers Bar?</h2><p>Who would turn down an opportunity to be in a Snickers ad, right? The thing is, not all celebrities are willing to get silly for their commercial spots. Betty was, though, even if she didn't go looking for the opportunity.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: </span><a href=#><span class=related-single>5 Sweetest Things Betty White Has Ever Said (& Her 5 Most Hilarious Burns)</span></a></p><p>In an interview a few years back (that Snickers spot was in 2010!), Betty <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted</a> that one of her bucket list goals was to be in a Lifetime movie. Fortunately for the star, she made that dream come true not long after. But being in a candy bar commercial wasn't on her radar, and the opportunity really fell into her lap.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But Betty White doesn't really seem to say no to any chance at acting, and she clearly realized that a Super Bowl spot would be good for her image.</p><h2 id=why-did-betty-white-like-being-in-the-snickers-commercial>Why Did Betty White Like Being In The Snickers Commercial?</h2><p>So did Snickers pay Betty some big bucks to pretend to get tackled in the mud? While some speculate that she actually did her own stunts for the commercial (unlikely! she was already 88), the paycheck for the gig wasn't the highlight for White.</p><p>Instead, Betty explained that she was grateful for the opportunity because it opened even more doors for her. After all, as the interviewer noted, Betty "came back into the spotlight again" with the Super Bowl debut.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But Betty pointed out that she'd never even left. Which is the whole point; Snickers put her back on the map, and created a demand for White to appear in more ads.</p><p>After Snickers came Pepsi and Doritos, Betty explained, asking her to be in their commercials (and host a giveaway where fans could create their own commercials for a chance at a cash prize).</p><p>Betty pointed out that Doritos and Pepsi "came after" her, which meant she was soon very busy with work.</p><p>And yet, she confessed, she was "thoroughly enjoying everything" -- something she's still doing now, even as <a href=#>fans wonder whether she'll ever retire</a>. It's been ten years since that candy bar spot, and Betty's still going strong!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>This Is How Betty White Spends Her $75 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdl7K1wNhmrqGhpJp6rbvVnptmq56esKyx0axkrK2gmr9urs6wo2abn6K6pr7CopilZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-unsuspecting-100-million-net-worth-of-kevin-james.html><span>←</span><span>The Unsuspecting $100 Million Net Worth Of Kevin James</span></a>
