He built his fortune on a film discography that spans six decades.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Allen made his film debut with the 1965 screwball comedy What's New Pussycat? co-starring Peter Sellers and Ursula Andress. The film grossed $18.8 million while its Tom Jones-sung theme song garnered an Oscar nomination for its writers, Burt Bacharach and Hal David. The bespectacled newcomer re-teamed with Sellers and Andress in the 1967 James Bond spoof Casino Royale.</p><p>In 1969, Allen began his long run of acting-directing vehicles with Take the Money and Run, a crime comedy that earned the 34-year-old two Golden Laurel nominations.</p><p>He catapulted to comedic stardom with his 1971–73 capers Bananas, Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask), and Sleeper, which each earned eight figures on $2 million budgets.</p><p>After the 1975 period comedy Love and Death, Allen entered his most acclaimed period with Annie Hall, the 1977 dramedy that won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. He delved into serious storytelling with the 1978 drama Interiors and the 1979 noire dramedy Manhattan. His '70s films co-starred his then-partner and muse, Diane Keaton.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The early '80s was a fall-back period for Woody, marked by the lukewarm reception to his 1980–82 films Stardust Memories and A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy.</p><p>Allen regained ground with the 1984–85 cult films Broadway Danny Rose and The Purple Rose of Cairo, both acclaimed efforts that culminated in the 1986 box office smash Hannah and Her Sisters, which grossed $40.1 million on a budget of $6 million.</p><p>He rounded out the decade with the 1987–89 hits Radio Days, New York Stories, and Crimes and Misdemeanors, all co-starring his then-partner Mia Farrow.</p><p>Allen's '90s hits include the '20s-period caper Bullets Over Broadway and the 1995 dramedy Mighty Aphrodite, which won newcomer Mira Sorvino an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.</p><p>In the 2000s, Allen began a working relationship with Scarlett Johansson, the star of his 2005–06 films Match Point and Scoop. The former grossed $85.3 million on a budget of $15 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=have-woody-allen-39-s-scandals-ruined-his-legacy>Have Woody Allen's Scandals Ruined His Legacy?</h2><h3 id=woody-allen-39-s-scandals-impacted-his-career>Woody Allen's scandals impacted his career</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/untitled-1.jpg><p>In August 1992, news surfaced that Allen was having an affair with Farrow's 21-year-old adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn. He and Farrow ended their thirteen-year association amid a public scandal that stole headlines from that summer's Republican National Convention.</p><p>Farrow adopted Soon-Yi in 1976 when she was married to composer André Previn. The couple adopted four children and had three biological sons.</p><p>After Farrow's divorce, she started a relationship with Allen, who took a paternal role in Soon-Yi's life when she was a teenager. By the fall of 1991, he became intimate with the now-adult South Korean adoptee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The scandal broke after Farrow discovered nudes of Soon-Yi in Allen's possession. Despite their public image as a couple up until the scandal, Allen and Farrow ended their romance in late 1987 after the birth of their biological son, Satchell Ronan.</p><p>The ensuing flurry greeted Allen's 1992 film Husbands and Wives, in which Woody and Mia play a married couple who divorce after witnessing the marital woes of their two best friends (a couple who ultimately reconcile). In a classic case of life imitating art, this was their final film together.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Woody-Allen.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="What Happened To Woody Allen's Mysterious Ex-Wife Harlene Rosen?">What Happened To Woody Allen's Mysterious Ex-Wife Harlene Rosen?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>After decades of being out of the spotlight, Woody Allen's wife recently spoke out about her famous and controversial ex-husband.</p><p>In 2017, controversies resurfaced after Dylan Farrow (Woody and Mia's adopted daughter) made allegations of sexual abuse against Allen. Soon-Yi and Mia's estranged adopted son, Moses Farrow, countered that Mia was the abusive parent and that she coerced her children against Allen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The controversy has polarized Hollywood. <a href=#>Scarlett Johansson has spoken positively about Woody Allen</a> throughout the years. Other stars, like <a href=#>Kate Winslet and Drew Barrymore, regret working with Woody Allen</a>.</p><p>Spanish actor <a href=#>Javier Bardem has defended Woody Allen</a>, calling the allegations "gossip." Bardem, who met his wife Penélope Cruz on the set of Allen's 2008 romcom Vicky Cristina Barcelona, told The Guardian that it's dangerous to point fingers at someone whose alleged guilt "hasn’t been legally proven."</p><p>With a box office gross of $96 million, Vicky Cristina Barcelona is Allen's third-highest-grossing film behind Midnight in Paris ($154 million) and Blue Jasmine ($99 million).</p><h2 id=woody-allen-is-still-making-movies>Woody Allen Is Still Making Movies</h2><h3 id=allen-lost-some-projects-but-continues-to-work-in-hollywood>Allen lost some projects but continues to work in Hollywood</h3><p>In 2016, Allen directed the blockbuster romcom Café Society co-starring Parker Posey, Kristen Stewart, and Blake Lively.
