Both have commented on how they care for one another, proving that just because a marriage did not last, the relationship does not have to be contentious and vile and <a href=#>can be a good experience</a> instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But what if all of this kindness, decency, and friendship is just for show? Could it be that while Johnson appears to be an open book to his fans, there are secrets that have not been revealed about his relationship with Garcia? Some fans seem to believe that this is the case.</p><p>They do not think that the Black Adam star is really as nice as he appears to be. Instead, they believe that there has been an arrangement between Johnson and Garcia to conceal <a href=#>what really happened between the two that caused Johnson and Garcia to divorce</a> over a decade ago.</p><p>Could Dany Garcia be keeping quiet about her and Dwayne Johnson's shared past?</p><h2 id=dany-garcia-and-dwayne-johnson-were-married-for-11-years>Dany Garcia And Dwayne Johnson Were Married For 11 Years</h2><p>Garcia and Johnson met while they were attending the University of Miami. They were very young, with the Moana star being just 18 years old and Garcia having turned 21. There was an instant connection and the two started dating. After both graduated from college, they eventually tied the knot in 1997 to start their life of wedded bliss.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eventually, Garcia and Johnson had a child together in 2001. That child was Simone Johnson. But when his first daughter was born, the Red Notice star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was deep into his WWE career and starting to transition into becoming a Hollywood star</a>.</p><p>As such, there was not much time for him to be around. And this could have been one of the causes of the breakdown of his relationship with Garcia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dwayne-johnson-dany-garcia-in-an-interview-1.jpg><p>"I had her (Simone) when I was young, in my 20s, and as dudes, we’re still trying to find ourselves in our 20s, in our 30s," Johnson explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"If we’re lucky, we reach our fourth level, and we find ourselves a little bit. We get a little bit more wiser. So, when I had Simone, I was flying by the seat of my pants. I was wrestling full-time, I started transitioning into acting full-time."</p><p>It was during this time that Garcia and Johnson realized that they were no longer working as a couple. As such, in 2007, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Garcia and the Jungle Cruise star decided to separate</a> after spending "over a year" dissecting their relationship and figuring out where things went wrong.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Dany Garcia Went From Dwayne Johnson's Ex-Wife To Manager In The Same Year</a></span></p><p>"We spent over a year looking at the things that didn't work in our marriage, the reasons why, making sure those elements had been cleared and taken care of, and that we had a real understanding of respect," Garcia explained.</p><p>"We were like, 'Okay, we're human, so we're going to work through that.' But if you have this agreement that no one is going to leave the table, suddenly you can tackle everything."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But despite all of this hard work, in 2008, Garcia and Johnson's divorce was finalized.</p><h2 id=could-dany-garcia-be-hiding-a-troubled-past-with-dwayne-johnson>Could Dany Garcia Be Hiding A Troubled Past With Dwayne Johnson?</h2><p>Despite both Johnson and Garcia claiming that the decision to end their marriage was a mutual one, fans seem to believe that there is a troubled past between the two that they have decided to keep covered up so that their professional relationship can thrive.</p><p>One of the biggest rumors that surround the two is that the Ballers star cheated on Garcia. The alleged cheating <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">happened well before Johnson met his now-wife</a>, Lauren Hashian.</p><p>"Congratulations to Dwayne Johnson #TheRock and #LaurenHashian," actress Robbin Young tweeted after Johnson and Hashian married. "Hopefully, Dwayne will be faithful to Lauren and not commit adultery like he did with me in 2004 while he was married to Dany @DanyGarciaCo."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dwayne-johnson-and-dany-garcia-gma.png><p>If Johnson had an affair with Young when he was married to Garcia, it is unclear why she waited until 2019 to share with the world that this happened. And when the tweet was made, fans wrote Young off as being jealous that Johnson did not pursue a relationship with her, choosing Hashian instead.</p><p>Johnson has admitted to dating Hashian while he was still married to Garcia. However, the two were already separated and on their way to being divorced. As such, while technically married, there was not any cheating involved there either, despite what fans may want to believe.</p><p>This does not mean that Johnson was perfect; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he admitted to as much</a> in the years after his divorce was finalized.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Dany Garcia Quit A Prestigious Job To Represent Her Ex-Husband Dwayne Johnson</a></span></p><p>"I don’t quite know what my expectation of marriage was back then," Johnson explained. "I had made a lot of mistakes and I didn’t have the ability or the wherewithal or I think the capacity to stop for a moment and say, 'God, I’m really screwing up. Let me just stop for a moment. Let’s talk about this.'"</p><p>What those mistakes were is unclear.</p><h2 id=dwayne-married-lauren-hashian-after-13-years-and-two-kids-together>Dwayne Married Lauren Hashian After 13 Years (And Two Kids) Together</h2><p>The mistakes that Johnson made years ago with his marriage to Garcia are not what he wanted to repeat. Because of this, <a href=#>he almost did not marry Hashian</a>. By taking some time to get into the right headspace, the Skyscraper star finally said "I do" 13 years after meeting Hashian.</p><p>When Johnson met Hashian, he admitted he had a wall up. And it was not until that wall came down that he was truly able to be in a happy and trusting relationship with his <a href=#>now-music producer/singer wife</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This meant being honest with himself about where he failed in his first marriage. In doing so, not only did the relationship Johnson had with Hashian grow stronger, but the one with Garcia did as well.</p><p>While Garcia and Johnson always promised to have respect for one another, that respect has grown into a very strong friendship and business partnership as well. Because of this, the two always have one another's back. And while this is very healthy, it is also where the rumors spark that Garcia will do whatever she has to, to protect Johnson as it protects her assets as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Money Did Dwayne Johnson's Ex Dany Garcia Get From Their Divorce?</a></span></p><p>However, it does not appear that there is anything from the past that Garcia is trying to cover up. Instead, by all accounts, both she and Johnson have been very upfront about their relationship and how hard they worked to get it to where it is today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the dynamic between the two may not work for everyone, they are definitely showing that divorcing a spouse does not always have to have a negative outcome.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdmcSixc2eZKOnmKPAsLqMnJ%2BemaRivK95w5qlsmWXlr%2BktcBo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1432526-cm-punks-lawyer-comments-on-aew-termination.html><span>←</span><span>CM Punks Lawyer Comments On AEW Termination</span></a>
