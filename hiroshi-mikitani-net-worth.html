After two years, he changed the name of the company to Rakuten, Inc. He is also the head of the E-Commerce and Banking Business Units and the head of the Development Units. He continues to work on the acquisition of additional companies to help grow his global offerings as well as to challenge major online stores such as Amazon and eBay.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hiroshi Mikitani has spent more than $1 billion over the past few years in obtaining Buy.com in the U.S. and Play.com in the U.K. to name a few. He also implemented a project called “Englishnization”, which will gradually make English the language of Rakuten despite having a majority of Japanese staff. He believes that English is not an advantage but it is a requirement. In May 2012, he bought a $100 million stake in the photo-sharing site Pinterest as well as Kobo, Canada’s e-book reader company, earlier that year. Lately, he has benefited from online deregulation when the bans on online drug sales and election campaigning was lifted. This means he can rake in more money in Japan. Among his major titles included the director of Kobo Inc., and the chairman of Rakuten Card Co., Ltd., Rakuten Travel Inc., Fusion Communications Corporation and Crimson Football Club, Inc.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BvsdOwpqusmGSwprjEm6mirKlir7a%2FyKecrKtfmLKwe8eiqairmJ56rrXKoquappliu6bAjLCmq6yYZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heather-leigh-meisner-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Heather Leigh Meisner Net Worth How Much is Meisner Worth?</span></a>
