After both of those shows came to an end, Grande went on to launch her singing career and become one of her generation’s biggest stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thanks to the lovable way she rose to fame and how incredibly talented she is as a singer, Ariana Grande has millions of extremely loyal fans. As is the case with most people who have that many followers, there has been a lot of interest in Grande’s personal life over the years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Fans Think The Weeknd Was Secretly Dating Ariana Grande</a></span></p><p>Even though Ariana Grande currently is married to Dalton Gomez and her fans want to <a href=#>know all about their relationship and wedding</a>, there still is a lot of interest in her famous exes. Of course, it could easily be argued that people talk about <a href=#>when Grande dated Pete Davidson</a> the most.</p><p>On top of people still talking about Ariana Grande’s former relationship with Pete Davidson, there is a lot of interest in the fact that she is rumored to have dated a comedy legend. Putting aside the rumors, it is interesting to get down to the facts about whether Grande really did date Jim Carrey or not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ariana-grande-rsquo-s-long-lasting-connection-to-jim-carrey>Ariana Grande’s Long Lasting Connection To Jim Carrey</h2><p>For a long time, stars who went on the talk show circuit would take part in one interview after another in which they would be asked the same questions about their latest project over and over. More recently, that has begun to change thanks to shows like YouTube’s Hot Ones mixing up the format.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ariana Grande Completely Embarrassed An Interviewer During A Live Radio Show</a></span></p><p>Even though there is value in interviewers asking stars questions about their latest projects, it often is a lot more interesting when they inquire about more timeless topics. A perfect example of that was one of the questions Ariana Grande was asked when she appeared on Live! With Kelly and Michael in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the aforementioned interview, Michael Strahan asked Ariana Grande who her childhood crush was. In response, <a href=#>Grande revealed that she has always had a crush on Jim Carrey</a> and she continued to feel the same way about him at the time of the interview.</p><p>"My childhood crush, like, my lifelong crush, it kind of all goes together -- it's Jim Carrey. I love him so much.” After revealing how much affection she has for Carrey, Ariana Grande went on to describe what it was like to meet him for the first time.</p><p>"I met him, and like, cried. It was really weird. It was so weird. It was so uncharacteristic of me. I'm usually sort of chill. I'm usually somewhat contained, but I met him and [makes crying face]. I couldn’t control myself”</p><p>“I was kind of nervous to meet him, because, I was like, you know, he's been my crush forever. What if he's not as nice as I'm expecting? He was so over-the-top nice, and perfect, and just as I hoped he'd be.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“[He said to me in] his classic Jim Carrey, 'Nice to meet ya. Thank you. Remember, be nice.' I was like, 'Oh my God, you're so cute. I love you.' I was like, 'Wow, help me God, thank you.'"</p><p>Around the same time as the aforementioned interview, Ariana Grande posted a video of herself meeting Jim Carrey for the first time on Instagram. Thanks to that video, it is clear that Grande’s description of that meeting was accurate since she was clearly overcome with emotion.</p><h2 id=did-ariana-grande-and-jim-carrey-ever-date>Did Ariana Grande And Jim Carrey Ever Date?</h2><p>After Ariana Grande revealed her lifelong crush on Jim Carrey, she went on to make a cameo appearance on the actor’s show Kidding. After filming the cameo, photos of Grande and Carrey looking friendly on the set of the show were posted online.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of working with Jim Carrey on the show Kidding, Ariana Grande has quoted the famous actor’s comments about mental health issues on social media in the past. If all of that wasn’t enough, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grande even got a tattoo</a> of the catchphrase Jim Carrey’s Truman Show character was known for on her shoulder.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Ariana Grande Appeared On Jim Carrey's Show 'Kidding'</a></span></p><p>For his part, Jim Carrey has responded to Ariana Grande in the past. Most notably, when Grande quoted Carrey’s take on mental health issues, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he commented with nothing but praise for her</a>. “I admire your openness. I wish you freedom and peace. I feel blessed to have such a gifted admirer.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on the mutual admiration that Ariana Grande and Jim Carrey obviously seem to share, rumors that the pair were a couple began to pop up. Despite that, there has never been any evidence that Grande and Carrey have ever been anything aside from friendly with each other.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq6GRo65us9GapZ2dXZa7pXnJoqRmm5Gnv6bFjJ2YraGenHqzwcyoqWaboqrAqXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./usman-umar-sojaboy-nigeria-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-169411-html.html><span>←</span><span>Usman Umar Sojaboy Nigeria Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality</span></a>
