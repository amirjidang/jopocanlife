But then, as a late teen, early 20s, I had a boyfriend who was&nbsp;<a href=#>obsessed&nbsp;with John Cena</a>, so much so that he dressed as John Cena for his 21st birthday and had a cardboard cut-out of John Cena in his bedroom.”</p><p class=p1>That’s right, Robbie’s boyfriend at the time had purchased a life-size cutout of the 44-year-old&nbsp;<i>F9</i>&nbsp;actor. So, every night when she went to bed, Cena was there to watch over her.</p><p class=p1>“So I slept in a room for two years with a life-size cardboard cut-out of John Cena in the room,” she added, explains that seeing his 2-D face in the corner of the room would startle her if she woke up in the middle of the night. “And then I’d be&nbsp;like, ‘Oh, it’s just John Cena, it’s OK.’”</p><p class=p1>When the costars first met, Robbie was initially wary about revealing her former passions to the former wrestler yet ended up spilling the beans some “five seconds into meeting him.”<span class=s1><br></span></p><p class=p1>After the&nbsp;<i>Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood&nbsp;</i>star told the story, she explained, “Now I know that there’s very little to weird out this guy!”</p><p class=p1>Anderson, 50, then brought out a <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> for the action star after hearing about the costars’ history: A cardboard cut-out of <a href=#>Robbie as Harley Quinn</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Margot-Robbie-Had-a-Cardboard-Cutout-of-John-Cena-in-Her-Room-for-Two-Years-Inline.jpg><p class=p3>“You also have to sleep with that in your room for two years,” Robbie jokingly said. “Just to level the playing field,” to which Cena nonchalantly agreed.</p><p class=p1>During the segment, the director, 54, revealed his own history with the&nbsp;<i>Black-ish&nbsp;</i>alum. Gunn explained that when he wrote <a href=#>the&nbsp;<i>Scooby-Doo&nbsp;</i>movies</a> in the early 2000s, Anderson was brought in to read for a few of the characters.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I wanted to congratulate you on your success because we haven’t seen each other in 20 years,” Anderson remarked.</p><p class=p1>The actors star in Gunn’s take on&nbsp;<i>The Suicide Squad&nbsp;</i>alongside <a href=#><strong>Idris Elba</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Sylvester Stallone</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Taika Waititi</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Viola Davis</strong></a>, which is slated for release on August 6.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaKcvLV50aiZm6GVYryvr8Rmn5qcXZZ6q7vHp2ScnZ6WeqSt0Z2ZqJmimXqkwdOorK1lmaN6qbHRZqmop51k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./magnus-carlsen-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-161394-html.html><span>←</span><span>Magnus Carlsen Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
