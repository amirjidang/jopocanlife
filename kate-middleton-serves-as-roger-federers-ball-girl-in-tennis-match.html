They certainly taught us a few things!”</p><p class=p1>During one moment of Federer’s serve, Kate — who is <a href=#>the current patron of the Wimbledon Tennis Club</a> — caught the ball with one hand.</p><p class=p1>“Are you allowed to do that?” he posited to ball girl <strong>Mollie</strong> before the Duchess of Cornwall chimed in. “Oh wait, are you allowed to do that?” she asked. “That’s a good question.”</p><p class=p1>Federer, in turn, pointed out that in Australia “they would catch it,” but it is not regulation&nbsp;at Wimbledon.</p><p class=p1>“Yeah, you’re not meant to catch it,” Mollie told the pair. “You’re meant to let it bounce and then catch it, but good catch.”</p><p class=p1>The <a href=#>annual tennis championships</a> will take place at the England stadium beginning on Wednesday, July 3. It will conclude nearly two weeks later on Sunday, July 16.</p><p class=p1>The Duchess of Cambridge — who <a href=#>shares three children</a> with husband <a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a> — <a href=#>showed off her sporty side</a> during the pre-tournament outing and <a href=#>wore her tennis whites</a> with a high ponytail. Kate even tried out a few training exercises of tossing tennis balls before <a href=#>picking up a racket herself</a>.</p><p class=p1>Kate — who has watched <a href=#>many Wimbledon matches</a> from the royal box, including the 2022 contest <a href=#>where she brought son Prince George</a> — became the organization’s patron in May 2016 when she took over for <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>. The duchess also serves as the patron for the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club.</p><p class=p1>Kate grew up as a fan of the sport and<a href=#> specifically of Federer</a> long before receiving her patronages.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Roger is <a href=#>my mother’s heartthrob</a>,” Kate gushed in the June 2017 BBC One documentary&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Sue Barker: Our Wimbledon</a>.&nbsp;</i>“I don’t think she will mind me saying that. I think he probably knows that too.”</p><p class=p1>She added: “I was really taken by <strong>[Andre] Agassi</strong> and <strong>[Pete] Sampras</strong>, <strong>[Goran] Ivanisevic</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Steffi Graf</strong>. That for me was my first memories. … [Wimbledon] <a href=#>inspires young people, including myself</a>. Every time Wimbledon is on I am thinking, ‘Yes, I could do the same’ and get out the racket. Sadly, not the same results.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to see photos:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKLAxGakopyUobK1u81mqp6qpprAbq3SZqmon5Wneqexw56pnqqjYq%2BiuMtmnqKqnGK2r3nTnqWnoaNiuqLAwqFm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jonathan-turley-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-188476-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jonathan Turley Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
