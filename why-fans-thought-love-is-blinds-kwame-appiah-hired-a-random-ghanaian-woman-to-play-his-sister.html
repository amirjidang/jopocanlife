Amid people saying that "they don't even love each other," Kwame posted a series of photos on Instagram, showing their interactions off-camera. "All of this content was taken during our engagement, when the big cameras weren't on us," he wrote in the caption.</p><p>"We got to enjoy life, and communicate, in the ways that feel most natural to us," he continued. "Just a quick response to anyone saying 'they have no chemistry', or 'they don't even love each other' .. based on what you saw, I don't blame you for thinking that. But actually, we had the MOST fun together falling in love!"</p><h2><img alt="Chelsea and Kwame kissing on Love is Blind" height=675 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chelsea-and-kwame-kissing-on-love-is-blind.jpg width=1200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h2><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with People</a> in March 2023, Chelsea also clarified that she and <a href=#>"mean girl," Micah Lussier</a> are all good despite the latter previously dating Kwame. "It was a part of our journey," said the new Mrs. Appiah. "You're going into an experience where the person that you like is dating 15 other women."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She added: "It is a very unique experience, and we are multifaceted people and it's okay for him to make that connection that he had with Micah. And in Mexico, there was tequila flowing, there was a lot happening, and you have cameras all around you. It's an elevated, intense experience."</p><p>Speaking about that tensed pool party, Chelsea said that she saw everything, but "it wasn’t in my nature to interject in their conversation." She also acknowledged that there was "some closure that needed to happen," despite it being "uncomfortable [to watch] at times."</p><p>"I respect Kwame's journey, and I don’t have any bad blood towards Micah," she continued. "The way I see it, if someone else is so into my man, then she's probably cool. She's probably awesome like me. I do feel that. And there's no bad blood there. And I just think everything happened for a reason."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Love Is Blind Season 4: What Micah And Irina Have Said About Being The 'Mean Girls'</a></span></p><h2 id=has-love-is-blind-39-s-chelsea-met-kwame-39-s-mother-yet>Has Love Is Blind's Chelsea Met Kwame's Mother Yet?</h2><p>During the reunion, Chelsea confirmed that she had finally met Kwame's mother. In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Today</a>, the former shared that she'd met the matriarch during Thanksgiving 2022. "It was a beautiful time," she recalled. "It was a loud, fun, loving family and I loved it. Yes, there's still room to grow with his mom but it was a perfect first visit. She really saw my character and who I was."</p><p>She also said that she gets why Kwame's mother didn't approve of their marriage at first. "This was a very non-traditional, fast experience where he had to follow his own heart. That does have consequences and we've worked through that," she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chelsea-and-kwame-kissing-on-love-is-blind.jpg><p>Kwame agreed with his wife's statement, noting that he'd begun to understand his mother's concerns as time passed. "I've realized this is more complicated, even when you take the experiment and the show out of it," he said of his marriage. "Meeting someone and getting married is such a complicated situation."</p><p>He continued: "It made sense that she wanted me to take more time and be more considerate of what the journey really is. But we're on great terms right now. I'm so grateful for my mom. And I'm very happy with where we are. I think we're progressing at the right rate to make sure that we all end up happy on the other end."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Love Is Blind's Sal Perez Didn't Marry Mallory, But He Did Find Love Between Filming</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-kwame-really-hire-a-fake-sister-in-love-is-blind>Did Kwame Really Hire A Fake Sister In Love Is Blind?</h2><p>During the reunion, Kwame also clarified that he didn't hire an actor to play his sister. After moving to Seattle to be with Chelsea, Kwame even revealed that his wife got to spend some quality time with his family. "There was some real family time … So they [Chelsea and my mom] had a good first encounter," he said, "and we will leave it at that. And it's all about just progressing from there."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kwame-and-chelsea-on-love-is-blind.jpg><p>Twitter is also now at peace, knowing that Barbara is Kwame's real sister. "Unfortunately false," one tweeted of the rumors. "I just went down a rabbit hole locating family photos — but would love this if it were true." Well, this just goes to show that Kwame and Chelsea's romance might have really been filmed a certain way to make it look fake.
