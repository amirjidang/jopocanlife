Among other expenses, BottleKeeper spent $4 million on Facebook ads to attract customers and $500,000 to enforce its patents.</p><p>They claimed that since they were only selling online and since over 3 000 US businesses wanted to carry BottleKeeper in-store, they needed a substantial infusion of cash to expand their internet market into physical stores. Hence, they sought investment from Shark Tank.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bottlekeeper-shark-tank-story-and-update></span>Bottlekeeper Shark Tank Story And Update<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Two cousins, Adam Callinan and Matt Campbell disliked it when their beer began to warm up after a time.</p><p>They can’t possibly gulp every beer bottle they have in their possession. Sometimes you just want to relax with your pals and enjoy it slowly. Once, the cousins and their uncle were enjoying beers in the hot tub.</p><p>They poured their drinks into plastic cups to prevent shattered glass from entering the hot tub, and the beer warmed up more quickly than the hot tub’s water did. The two of them were motivated by this to develop BottleKeeper as a means of keeping their beer cold and reducing the possibility of broken glass.</p><p>The cousins used crowdfunding to raise $13,000, which led to the creation of the multipurpose and single-serving cooler for their beer, and in five years the company grew significantly. They presented a pitch for their patented item BottleKeeper on Season 10 of “Shark Tank,” in search of a $1 million investment in exchange for 5% ownership.</p><p>They received what they needed from&nbsp;Mark Cuban, and Lori Greiner, the queen of QVC, who added a $2.50 royalty until $2 million is returned. Sales for Bottlekeeper increased by 300 percent in just the first day after the “Shark Tank” episode aired.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=did-bottlekeeper-go-out-of-business-where-is-owner-adam-callinan-now></span>Did Bottlekeeper Go Out Of Business? Where Is Owner Adam Callinan Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2021, Bottlekeeper made around $13.5 million in revenue and is still successfully operating worldwide.</p><p>After the pitch, in just three years from the start of their production to the launch of their website, Adam Callinan and Matt Campbell made a startling $20 million in revenue.</p><p>The time was ripe to inject funds to expand the production and spread them in the brick-and-mortar retailing segments because there was a significant waitlist of over 3000 US online businesses that wanted to sell the product in-store. The product was a success on the market, doing well, and being valued at $100 million.</p><p>In order to attract customers, BottleKeeper has expanded its product lines to include CanKeeper, PintKeeper, Accessories, and many more packaged deals. They also began by printing unique designs on their products. In response to complaints that the first model did not insulate the bottle for very long, the line now also includes BottleKeeper X, a double-walled bottle.</p><p>The founder, Adam Callinan is still associated with the company and serves as the Chief Beer Digester & CEO of Bottlekeeper. He resides with his wife Katie and kid in Manhattan Beach. Likewise, founder Matt Campbell is also working in the company as its president.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJqfqcGtscqenKmdomK7psCMsKarrJhirq%2BwjKyfmqqbYsGiuspmrKmckamybsPHnqmeZZmoerDDzZ6pZpmUlrpur8Clo6KmkaN6r7vWZmlo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bobby-brown-whitney-houston-biopic-1234715842.html><span>←</span><span>Bobby Brown &amp;quot;Don't Know Nothing About&amp;quot; Upcoming Whitney Houston Biopic</span></a>
