Reynolds secured his first significant movie payday with 2011's The Green Lantern, earning a reported $15 million salary for the movie. The movie turned out to be one of the most significant box-office disappointments in history, managing to gross only $220 million despite a hefty production budget of $200 million. However, Ryan Reynolds’s paycheck cleared and he met his <a href=#>future wife Blake Lively on set</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ryan Reynolds significantly boosted his earnings from playing Deadpool, despite a relatively modest upfront payment. While rumors circulated that he initially earned around $2 million for the first film, Reynolds negotiated substantial backend points, resulting in a total payday of $22 million due to the movie's immense success. For Deadpool 2, Ryan Reynolds' earnings climbed even higher, with estimates suggesting he could have made up to $40 million. The details of his compensation for Deadpool 3 are unclear, but given the remarkable success of the first two films, it's anticipated to be Reynolds' most substantial payday in his acting career.</p><p>His compensation soared with the <a href=#>2019 Netflix film 6 Underground</a>, where he brought in an impressive $27 million. In 2021's Red Notice, where he starred alongside <strong><a href=#>Dwayne Johnson</a></strong> and Gal Gadot, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Reynolds earned $20 million</a>, according to Forbes. Continuing his success, Reynolds earned another $20 million for his role opposite Will Ferrell in the 2022 film Spirited. <strong>These substantial paychecks contribute significantly to Ryan Reynolds' overall financial success with a $350 million net worth in the entertainment industry.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ryan-reynolds-at-the-premiere-of-deadpool-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Ryan Reynolds Is Using His Fame For A Lot More Than Just Getting Movie Roles</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Does everything Ryan Reynolds touches turn to gold?

In 2020, his gin brand, <a href=#>Aviation American Gin</a>, proved to be a lucrative venture.</p><p>Reynolds sold his stake in the brand to Diageo for an impressive $610 million. Vanity Fair reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Diageo would pay Ryan Reynolds $335 million upfront</a>, with an additional potential payday of $275 million contingent on Aviation's performance over the next 10 years. As part of this deal, Reynolds also secured an "ongoing ownership stake," ensuring his continued involvement and potential future profits in the success of the gin brand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mint Mobile, recognized for offering some of the most affordable prepaid plans in the U.S., was recently acquired by T-Mobile for a substantial sum of $1.35 billion.
