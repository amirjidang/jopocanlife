Watching the star play teenager Laurie Strode is an incredible experience. Sure, the movie is one of the best in the genre, with crazed child killer Michael Myers, a picturesque setting, and great teenage characters. But people also love Halloween because of Jamie Lee Curtis's performance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Jamie Lee Curtis's Halloween salary</a> was very small, but she has a high net worth and has become an incredible success ever since the first movie. It's sweet learning that <a href=# rel=nofollow>the actress and Kyle Richards are close</a>, and it's a lot of fun watching them act together once again in Halloween Kills. There's also something that fans are curious about: did Jamie Lee Curtis really have her legs insured? Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=did-jamie-actually-insure-her-legs>Did Jamie Actually Insure Her Legs?</h2><p>There are many <a href=# rel=nofollow>celebrities who had body parts insured</a>... and is Jamie Lee Curtis one of them?</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jamie Lee Curtis's legs were insured for $1 million</a>... but there's more to the story. It wasn't the actor's decision.</p><p>According to People.com, the actress was in advertising campaigns for the pantyhose brand L'eggs and they insured her legs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are many other stars who have had legs insured. People reported that Taylor Swift's legs are insured for a total of $40 million.</p><p>What does it actually mean when someone's body parts are insured? It's definitely an interesting concept. According to Trustedchoice.com, if someone is handicapped, gets a scar or injury, or otherwise ruins that part of their body, that means that they can't do their job for a long time. According to Fox Business, Amy Danise from Insure.com said, “If you look at the purpose of insurance, it’s to rescue you financially in the event of disaster. It’s meant to save a person who would otherwise literally go under if they had that damage or that loss. For celebrities, it’s really unnecessary because they’re generally not being insured for amounts they couldn’t cover.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The idea of insuring body parts has also been around for a while. Lovemoney.com reported that Bette Davis had her waist insured for $28,000 (which would be $543,000 now) in the 1940's. Llyod's of London also insured Betty Grable's legs and the star said "There are two reasons why I am successful in show business and I am standing on both of them," according to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Front Row Insurance</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>This Is What Jamie Lee Curtis' Life And Net Worth Look Like Today</a></span></p><h2 id=jamie-mad-some-money-from-activia-commercials>Jamie Mad Some Money From Activia Commercials</h2><p>Many people probably remember seeing Jamie Lee Curtis starring in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">commercials for the yogurt brand Activia</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jamie Lee Curtis explained that these Activia commericals helped her find work/life balance and be with her family. This is great to hear since this is something that so many people struggle with.</p><p>According to Today.com, the actress said, "I’ve been doing commercials for a very, very, very long time partially so I can ameliorate all of that distance from my family. It allowed me to earn money and stay home."</p><p>When someone said on Twitter that Jamie Lee Curtis didn't have any money and claimed that she's not a fan of horror movies, suggesting that she needed to star in the 2018 Halloween, the actress wasn't having it. Jamie Lee Curtis tweeted, "You are a grumpy goat. I sold activia yogurt for seven years. I wasn’t broke."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Who Is Jamie Lee Curtis' Daughter, Annie Guest?</a></span></p><h2 id=39-halloween-39-changed-jamie-39-s-life>'Halloween' Changed Jamie's Life</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans are thrilled that Jamie Lee Curtis returned for Halloween in 2018 and that she's back for the new movie Halloween Kills.</p><p>In an interview with Vogue, Jamie Lee Curtis shared that she would like to produce and explained, "I want to pursue work where I’m not the star and instead get to be a cheerleader who supports artists in front of the camera."</p><p>The star also said that she likes knowing that she's going to have money coming in: "The only time I’ve ever known I was gonna make money was when I had a contract to sell Activia yogurt; I knew that I’d get paid X dollars over X amount of years. I’m 62 and I’ve been an actress since I was 19, so the word 'freelance' means unemployed to me."</p><p>Jamie Lee Curtis said that her mom and dad, Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis, had to stop acting and that was really heartbreaking: "My parents didn’t get to do what they loved, and watching that made me sad, so I just didn’t wanna feel that way."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is such an interesting perspective since many of us assume that celebrities are always bringing in the big bucks, but it's definitely possible for the work to feel unstable and uncertain.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>What Jamie Lee Curtis Said The First Time She Saw Her Future Husband</a></span></p><p>It's interesting to hear that a company once insured Jamie Lee Curtis's legs.
