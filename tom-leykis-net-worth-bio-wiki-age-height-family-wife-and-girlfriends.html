In the 1980s, Leykis states that during this time, it was the groundbreaking of his career in Radio. His then-girlfriend locked him out of the house in the belief that he did not have enough money. This motivated him to do better and years later, when he was more stable and on a renowned radio, his girlfriend called him to mend their relationship on a live radio talk show and he denied the request.</p><p>Years later, he began his own talk show, The Tom Leykis Show, which first aired on February 27, 1984, on WNWS in Miami. His show replaced Neil Rogers’ night show which aired on WNWS. Leykis and Rogers became career rivals and by the end of 1985, Leykis was the top-ranking evening talk show in the market. He left the station the same year and got a job at Phoenix’s KFYI, as program director.</p><p>Since then, Leykis has been promoted in various radio stations and has had an increasing number of listeners on his show due to his provocative nature and on October 13, 2018, he launched a new podcast series that is available on his website premiumtom.com</p><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-tom-leykis></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Tom Leykis</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-tom-leykis></span><span>Who is Tom Leykis?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Leykis is an American radio personality who is famously known for hosting The Tom Leykis Show, which has been on air since 1994 and was nationally syndicated till 2009.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-tom-leykis></span><span>How old is Tom Leykis?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Leykis is 64 years old as of 2020.
