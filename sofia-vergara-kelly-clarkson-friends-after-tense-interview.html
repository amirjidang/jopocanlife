Sign, A mad fan.”</p><p>This moment was offensive and problematic, and it's hard to know why Clarkson thought that this was appropriate.

When Vergara said that was "crazy," Clarkson said, “It looks slight." When the actress explained that she spent hours in hair and makeup, Clarkson kept suggesting that it was a small change.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Sofia Vergara Slammed This Talk Show Host After He Made Fun Of Her Accent</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Sofia Vergara's accent has been mocked many times in her career, but when a Spanish talk show host ridiculed her, she didn't accept it.</span><p>Vergara finally said loudly:</p><p>“It was a wig!

The singer said, “They did such a good job that it looks seamless. You just look like a different — like, you literally look like you could actually just be this person in another movie. You could have two careers. You look like you’re a different actress, like, playing the role. You could have a whole different life.”</p><p>In an interview with CBS News, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vergara chatted about Griselda</a>, and the publication reported that she sat in the makeup chair for three hours getting prosthetics on set.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What Is The Netflix Miniseries Griselda About?</p><ul><li>drug lord Griselda Blanco from Colombia</li><li>set during 1980s Miami</li><li>six episodes</li><li>also stars Alberto Guerra</li></ul><p>This interview felt even more uncomfortable considering how proud the star is of her miniseries Griselda and the hard work that she put into the role. In her interview with CBS News, Vergara explained "So, it was a lot, it was a lot of stress and a lot of work that I had to do behind the scenes. And I think by episode five, I totally became a monster and Griselda did too."</p><p>Kelly Clarkson's Sofia Vergara interview wasn't the only time that the talk show host was <strong>criticized for her words or her interview style</strong>. In 2019, when the show premiered, Redditor @MarionCotesworthHaye started a thread that said "I love you, Kelly Clarkson, but your new talk show is painful." They called her Dwayne Johnson chat "fine but unmemorable." A few fans replied that Clarkson doesn't allow the people who she is interviewing to talk.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clarkson's interrupting has become a common criticism.
