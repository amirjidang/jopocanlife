Courtesy of the Towers, they've been able to take that challenge and run with it - as we'll explain in more detail throughout the list.</p><h2 id=it-featured-at-mitb-2020><span class=item-num>15 </span><span><b>It Featured At MITB 2020</b></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/mitmbtib.jpeg><p>WWE knew they had to mix things up with Money in the Bank this year, and boy oh boy did they do that. They had both the women's match and the men's match running side by side with one another as superstars went all through WWE HQ before reaching the briefcases at the very top.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brock-lesnar-tried-to-destroy-it><span class=item-num>14 </span><span><b>Brock Lesnar Tried To Destroy It</b></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jimjho.jpeg><p>In the midst of his feud with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Triple H</a>, Brock Lesnar took it upon himself to go to WWE HQ and pretty much destroy The Game's office and most of the surrounding area. He also teased a feud with The Rock somewhere down the line which, unfortunately, never quite came to fruition.</p><h2 id=wwe-is-moving><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><b>WWE Is Moving</b></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bigbgi.jpeg><p>While the move has been delayed due to the pandemic, the plan is still for WWE to make the jump over to&nbsp;677 Washington Boulevard as they aim to relocate from Titan Towers in 2021.

If you ever wanted to drive from one to the other, it would take 16 hours of non-stop driving which equates to around 1,120 miles.

The building is actually seven stories tall with three levels of parking, and of course, is has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">unique</a> glass exterior that you rarely see in new builds these days.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Released WWE Stars Are Finally Speaking Out</a></span></p><h2 id=the-bischoff-tale><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><b>The Bischoff Tale</b></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bischa.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the news broke that Eric Bishoff and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Heyman</a> would be running the ship on SmackDown and RAW, many were intrigued to see what they'd be able to produce. For Bischoff, it meant moving to Stamford (according to the man himself), but just a few months later, he was moving back out of the city again after things didn't quite work out.</p><h2 id=wwe-digital><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><b>WWE Digital</b></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wm32.jpeg><p>All of that wonderful work you see being put out by the WWE digital team actually stems from Titan Towers - and that includes most of the work Cathy Kelley did when she was with the company, which we can all agree was a blessing in its own right.

He's Vince McMahon.
