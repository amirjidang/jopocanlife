You think you’re all set to create the chicest outfit ever, but when you finally put it all together in front of a mirror, something is off. Everything is cute, and yet there’s a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">missing element</a>.</p><p>That missing element, especially around this time of year? There’s a high chance it’s a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">beanie</a>! A cute beanie can totally change the entire vibe of an outfit. It can dress down something that’s a little too fancy, it can add some warmth and personality to an otherwise dull look and it can be used to bring out another color in your outfit, whether it’s matching or contrasting. Of course, it’s also a must for the cold!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kristin-cavallari-beanie.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">KBETHOS Soft Slouchy Beanie</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$10</a> at Amazon!

Just check your fave celebrities’ Instagrams or paparazzi shots and you’ll find a goldmine. In recent memory, we know we’ve seen <strong>Nikki Bella</strong> matching with her son in black beanies, <strong>Tayshia Adams</strong> rocking one while kicking back in her car and <strong>Zoe Kravitz</strong> wearing one while posing with her ballot. Two celebs whose beanie looks have really stuck with us though are <strong>Kristin Cavallari</strong> and <strong>Heidi Klum</strong>!</p><p>This fall alone, we’ve seen Cavallari wear a black beanie on a trip with friends, along with a mustard crew neck and leggings, in a selfie snuggling her son and in an Instagram Story video with a matching black top. Klum hasn’t held back either, wearing a camel-colored beanie while exploring Germany, posing with a blue beanie in the car and showing off yet another one to tease a collaboration with Disney Villains!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/heidi-klum-beanie.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">KBETHOS Soft Slouchy Beanie</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$10</a> at Amazon!
