He has loved me, pushed me, comforted me and been a pain in my backside through so many different phases of my life. If it weren’t for him I quite literally wouldn’t have completed this project. STORY TIME…a few months back he called me out about never following through or completing any professional aspirations I have had over the past few years. I definitely took that personally, because let’s be honest, nobody likes being called out. Without him even knowing it he challenged me to address a flaw I wasn’t willing to accept. His words resonated with me and they’re the reason I did not give up when I was tired, or when I got bored or wrapped up in motherhood and my personal issues. Anytime I wanted to wave the white flag I imagined his thick lovable accent challenging me to be the best version of myself. Giannis, thank you for believing in me, inspiring me and simply being you!”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mariah-riddlesprigger-career></span>Mariah Riddlesprigger Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mariah Riddlesprigger was announced as the ‘Conference USA Defensive Player of the Week’.
