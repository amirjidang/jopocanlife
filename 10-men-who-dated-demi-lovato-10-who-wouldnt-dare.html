She has overcome addiction&nbsp;many times. She has become an advocate for LGBT+ rights, committed herself to philanthropy, and raised awareness for issues, such as paying attention to mental health. She has done a lot of great things, but some people will remember her for the guys she's dated throughout her life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As of right now, she is in a relationship with singer/model, Austin Wilson. While we absolutely adore them together, here is a look back on the men Demi's dated and some that are strictly friends or acquaintances. Here are ten men&nbsp;who dated Demi and ten who wouldn't dare!</p><h2 id=dated-jai-manselle><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Dated: Jai Manselle</span></h2><p>Demi and Jai had a short-but-sweet relationship that lasted from September to December of 2012.&nbsp;They were seen at a restaurant in Detroit, displaying adorable affection. This was Demi's first relationship for a while, after splitting from Wilmer.</p><h2 id=wouldn-t-dare-simon-cowell><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Wouldn't Dare: Simon Cowell</span></h2><p>Demi joined the second season of the American version of The X Factor, which featured&nbsp;former American Idol judge, Simon Cowell. There was no doubt that he and Demi had great chemistry, but for dating?</p><p>Demi <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted</a> that he was not her type, but has mentioned he's a cool guy to hang out with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dated-trace-cyrus><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Dated: Trace Cyrus</span></h2><p>Trace is known as the older half brother of Miley and Noah Cyrus. While he had nothing much to do with Disney, he did date Demi for some time. As for the reason why they split, it had to do with age and distance. Afterward, Trace would have an on-and-off relationship with Brenda Song and was engaged to her until they broke it off.</p><h2 id=wouldn-t-dare-chris-brown><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Wouldn't Dare: Chris Brown</span></h2><p>At this point, it would be surprising if anyone wanted to date Chris Brown since he attacked Rihanna and got himself into lots of trouble. He attended Demi's Tell Me You Love Me tour and Demi covered Chris' song, "Turn Up the Music." However, it is just best if they never plan to get together.</p><h2 id=dated-jonathan-fryar><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Dated: Jonathan Fryar</span></h2><p>Demi's relationship with Jonathan is her earliest-known romance after she attainted serious stardom. Not much is known about them being together, other than the fact that they definitely didn't last for very long. Jonathan himself is just a big mystery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wouldn-t-dare-justin-bieber><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Wouldn't Dare: Justin Bieber</span></h2><p>One of Demi's best long-term friends is Selena Gomez and Selena was known for having a huge and public relationship with Justin Bieber. It might seem that Demi and Justin are not friends, but it's quite the opposite.</p><p>Now, there's no chance of them being romantically involved, but they have shown each other support on a few occasions, especially when Justin sent a heartfelt message related to her recent overdose.</p><h2 id=dated-luke-rockhold><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Dated: Luke Rockhold</span></h2><p>It was surprising to see Demi date an&nbsp;American mixed martial artist, but she and Luke had a brief (but cute) relationship. The relationship might not have lasted, they had nothing but nice things to say about one another. Luke has referred to Demi as fun, passionate, driven, and nice.</p><h2 id=wouldn-t-dare-jordan-francis><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Wouldn't Dare: Jordan Francis</span></h2><p>There is nothing more sweet than having a fantastic friendship. Demi and Francis are a great example of this. They worked together on Camp Rock 2 and, even though they have not done other projects together, it definitely seems these two will be friends for a long time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dated-alex-deleon><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Dated: Alex DeLeon</span></h2><p>Alex DeLeon from The Cab also had a relationship with Demi, lasting from 2008 to 2009. The song "Catch Me" was apparently about him, and the lyrics do say a lot that may refer to him. It is crazy to believe that the song was released ten years ago too!</p><h2 id=wouldn-t-dare-sterling-knight><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Wouldn't Dare: Sterling Knight</span></h2><p>Sometimes we wish that costars from TV shows or movies will get together, and sometimes it happens! While we rooted for Demi and Sterling's characters in Sonny With A Chance, they are only good friends in real life. They have reunited a few times and it does take us back.</p><h2 id=dated-guilherme-vasconcelos><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Dated:&nbsp;Guilherme Vasconcelos</span></h2><p>From the UFC to MMA, Demi also dated mixed martial artist&nbsp;Guilherme, also known as "Bomba." While there was apparently no bad blood between the two after they broke up, Demi did delete pictures of Guilherme afterward. We're sure that the MMA fighter took it well, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wouldn-t-dare-kevin-jonas><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Wouldn't Dare: Kevin Jonas</span></h2><p>Demi and the Jonas Brothers were very, very close. Demi dated one of them and has been close friends with another, but what about Kevin? Well, it's safe to say that even before he married&nbsp;Danielle&nbsp;Deleasa, they were nothing more than good friends.</p><h2 id=dated-cody-linley><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Dated: Cody Linley</span></h2><p>Cody has been a prominent actor on Disney Channel, starring in Hannah Montana as Jake Ryan, but out of nowhere, it was revealed that he dated Demi! They dated after she called it quits with Jonathan. Not much is known about their relationship, unfortunately.</p><h2 id=wouldn-t-dare-matthew-montgomery><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Wouldn't Dare:&nbsp;Matthew Montgomery</span></h2><p>These two's relationship seems odd since Matthew played a recurring role in So Random!, a spinoff of Demi's show, which she doesn't appear in. And yet, they have been shown to be amazing friends. Demi personally credits him and rapper Sirah for helping her stay healthy, as showcased on her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>.</p><h2 id=dated-wilmer-valderrama><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Dated:&nbsp;Wilmer Valderrama</span></h2><p>The one relationship that gained a lot of coverage and lasted the longest was with Wilmer. Their relationship lasted a crazy six years and had on-and-off times. Even though they are not together anymore, there was no doubt how much support he gave to her while she was recovering, and that is a huge accomplishment in any relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wouldn-t-dare-chris-colfer><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Wouldn't Dare: Chris Colfer</span></h2><p>Glee star Chris has gone on to say how amazing and unique Demi is. If you can't tell by the picture, they did pucker up and showed some affection, but friends can do that without having to be in a romantic relationship. Plus, he is gay, so it just wouldn't make sense for these two.</p><h2 id=dated-henry-levy><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Dated: Henry Levy</span></h2><p>Demi and Henry were&nbsp;an interesting pair; she is a singer/actress and he is a fashion designer. While they looked like they had the time of their lives, their timing was just terrible. Demi would be going through her treatment and her family would not approve of her getting into a relationship quickly, while also going through a difficult time.</p><h2 id=wouldn-t-dare-kevin-mchale><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Wouldn't Dare: Kevin McHale</span></h2><p>Demi and Kevin are an example of being cool friends, without having to feel awkward if they get too close. They hosted the Teen Choice Awards and their chemistry showed really well. They did grow up together and can joke with each other with ease. That is what we need in any friendship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dated-joe-jonas><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Dated: Joe Jonas</span></h2><p>Out of the Jonas Brothers, Joe was the one who had the opportunity to date Demi. They had a fantastic relationship, after working together on Disney Channel and touring together. However, they decided to break off the relationship to focus on their friendship, which was honestly the healthy and right decision.</p><h2 id=wouldn-t-dare-nick-jonas><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Wouldn't Dare: Nick Jonas</span></h2><p>Demi and Nick were like two peas in a pod. Their friendship was incredibly genuine and they were definitely very close. However, some things came up, such as Nick not inviting Demi to his wedding, and the latter removing him from her social media. Who knows what their status is after all of that mess happened.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWWdmrtuw8eoZJ2ZpJqxbrDEpqBmpJ%2BrrrW7jGpnZq%2BYpHq4u9Slm6esXZmus7GO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-so-many-of-billie-eilishs-outfits-have-caused-scandals-body-shaming.html><span>←</span><span>Why So Many Of Billie Eilish's Outfits Have Caused Scandals</span></a>
