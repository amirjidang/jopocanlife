<span>Kelle Repass</span></p><h1>Adele Pauses Las Vegas Show for Matthew Perry Tribute</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=#><strong>Adele</strong></a> is paying tribute to the late <a href=#>Matthew Perry</a>.</p><p>“It is always so shocking, especially someone that made you laugh and who brought so much joy to your life that you don’t know,” Adele, 35, said of Perry during her <a href=#>Las Vegas residency</a> show on Saturday, October 28, per <a href=#>social media footage</a>. “This is what I find so strange, I never met him in my life. There is something, you feel so sad about it especially because you don’t necessarily know what was going on.”</p><p>Hours before Adele’s concert, Perry was <a href=#>found dead</a> at the age of 54 in a jacuzzi at a home in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles coroner’s office <a href=#>confirmed his death</a> on Sunday, October 29, and the investigation is ongoing.</p><p>The late actor starred in the iconic sitcom <a href=#>Friends</a>, where he played the lovable and sarcastic Chandler Bing for the 10-season run. Adele was one of the millions who enjoyed the NBC sitcom, which aired from 1994 to 2004.</p><p>“I’ll remember that character for the rest of my life,” the singer said. “He’s probably the best comedic character of all time.”</p><p>She continued: “One of my favorite memories of when I was younger, with my friends, and one of my friends Andrew, when I was 12, did the best Chandler impression, and he would do it all the time to make us laugh. And if anyone was having a bad day or feeling low, he would pretend to be Chandler. And I will remember that character for the rest of my life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/adele-pauses-las-vegas-show-for-matthew-perry-tribute-inline.jpg><p>Adele, who dedicated her song “When We Were Young” to Perry, recently revealed that she <a href=#>stopped drinking alcohol</a> earlier this year. Perry, for his part, was candid about his battle with <a href=#>addiction and other health issues</a> during his lifetime.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He was so open with his struggles with addiction and sobriety, which I think is incredibly, incredibly brave,” she said. “I just wanna say how much I love what he did for us, especially what he did for me … and hopefully, now he can rest in peace.”</p><p>Adele was not the only one to honor the actor on Saturday night. During <a href=#>several NHL games</a>, an orchestral version of the iconic Friends theme song “I’ll Be Here For You” by The Rembrandts could be heard playing in the arena. (Perry was a longtime hockey fan, especially of the Los Angeles Kings, and attended their <a href=#>2014 Stanley Cup Playoffs</a> game against the St. Louis Blues.)</p><p><a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> also <a href=#>dedicated its episode</a> to Perry, who hosted an October 1997 episode and notably spoofed his own sitcom, portraying <a href=#><strong>Matt LeBlanc</strong></a>’s Joey Tribbiani. The NBC variety show added a special title card after the final sketch, alongside a black-and-white photo of Perry from his hosting debut, next to his name.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJidnZyaerGt1KycrGWclsBuwsSgmKxlo528uHnFqKlmpZGpwamx1mannqqirnq1vsibrK2dXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-benzema-garage-a-peek-inside-ballon-dor-winner-karim-benzemas-insane-car-collection.html><span>←</span><span>A Benzema Garage: A Peek Inside Ballon d'Or Winner Karim Benzemas Insane Car Collection</span></a>
