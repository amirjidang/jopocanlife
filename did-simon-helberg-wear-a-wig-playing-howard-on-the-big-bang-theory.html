Nowadays, fans are watching the reruns, while searching for behind the scenes information.Like for instance, <a href=#>the wine used in scenes was actually grape juice</a>. As for the food on the show, <a href=#>Kaley Cuoco would actually save her meals to eat them in front of the camera.</a> There would be lots of leftovers but that was all properly donated and not trashed.<span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>During Her Time On The Big Bang Theory, Kate Micucci Was Most Impressed By Simon Helberg</a></span>Another question TBBT fans have is related to Simon Helberg's hair on the show. Was it real, or was it fake like Eric on That '70s Show? During a Twitter Q&A, the actor finally answered the question. We'll take a look at what he had to say, along with taking a look back at his audition process.Let's get started!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=simon-helberg-came-close-to-skipping-his-big-bang-theory-audition>Simon Helberg Came Close To Skipping His Big Bang Theory Audition</h2><p>Oh, how different The Big Bang Theory could have looked! Jim Parsons almost lost out on his Sheldon role for appearing to be too perfect in his audition... Kaley Cuoco almost played a character named Katie while <a href=#>Johnny Galecki was initially reading for the role of Sheldon instead of Leonard.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Here's How Simon Helberg Reacted To A Fan Telling Him That 'Big Bang Theory' Sucked</a></span></p><p>As for Simon Helberg, he had his own conundrum entering the audition room. The actor was very much into his other pilot and in fact, <a href=#>he needed convincing from his agents to attend the audition for TBBT.</a></p><p>He discussed the process alongside The Hollywood Reporter, "I remember almost not going in because I was working on Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and it was the beginning of pilot season. I was working with a great group of people and loved this pilot."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I read Big Bang the year before — they shot it twice — and read it the first year. I thought, "Why are they doing this again?" There was a new character and it was great but I was on Studio 60 and my agents had to talk me into going."</p><p>Reading for the role of Howard, Helberg had a good feeling about the audition when he noticed Chuck Lorre smiling, something that was rare from the showrunner.</p><p>"I remember Chuck and Bill laughing a lot — and the look Chuck gave me. He can have a look in his eyes that you can't really read him but he was smiling. I thought some wheels were turning. I knew he liked what I did and I'll never forget hearing that laugh. It's still the highlight of my day when I hear that laugh," he told THR.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Simon thrived in the role and in truth, we can't picture anyone else as Howard. That all started with his look, one that had fans questioning certain things, such as that signature head of hair.</p><h2 id=simon-helberg-revealed-he-did-not-wear-a-wig-but-used-an-iron-for-his-hair>Simon Helberg Revealed He Did Not Wear A Wig But Used An Iron For His Hair</h2><p>Wearing a wig for the sake of a sitcom is not uncommon. That was the case for another popular sitcom from the 2000s, That '70s Show, as the main character played by Topher Grace, Eric wore a wig after season 1, given how damaged his hair had become prepping it for the role regularly.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Jim Parsons Almost Cried For Real During This Big Bang Theory Scene With Simon Helberg</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The same could have taken place with Simon Helberg as Howard, <a href=#>though he confirmed this was not the case</a>. That's right, the actor's hair was legitimate, and the key was passing an iron prior to shooting the episode.</p><p>He briefly touched on the topic during a Twitter Q&A session, "I don’t wear a wig,” he said. My hair is flat-ironed, however.”</p><p>Turns out, his hair isn't the biggest problem, it was trying to put on and take off his classic skinny jeans!</p><h2 id=putting-on-his-skinny-jeans-was-the-hardest-part-for-simon-helberg-and-his-portrayal-of-howard>Putting On His Skinny Jeans Was The Hardest Part For Simon Helberg And His Portrayal Of Howard</h2><p>Ah yes, who can forget Howard's classic belt buckles on the show? In truth, he really didn't need any extra support, as the pants were incredibly tight as is.</p><p>Helberg would reveal on the Twitter Q&A that taking off the skinny jeans was quite the task at the end of a shoot. It took some help from the production team...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I often need assistance getting in & out of those pants. Luckily there are well-paid women to help. Lucky for them," the actor said.</p><p>Once the show came to an end, Helberg made sure to leave with a memento, <a href=#>keeping his classic Nintendo belt buckle!</a> At the very least, he can put the belt on pants that are better fitted or at least, more comfortable!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdqLauu81mn56kkpq%2FqHnWnpirZZFixKqzjKmjmrGZo7RutM6wmKucXaS7bsDHnmSboZdir6K6xmaroZ2fp8Zw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./desi-perkins.html><span>←</span><span>Desi Perkins Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</span></a>
