A younger version of Myers weighed 300 pounds, and the emotional distress he suffered as a result of an incapability to keep up physically with his peers caused him to turn to junk food for comfort. A combination of bad eating habits and an overweight frame almost cost him his life at 21, where he was found to have an enlarged heart. Fast forward a decade later and 125 pounds lighter, and Myers has trained the likes of Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Adam Levine, and High Jackman as well as a host of <a href=#>Victoria Secret models.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=don-brooks>Don Brooks</h2><p>Don Brooks, also known as <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Don-A-Matrix</a>, has excelled as the go-to personal trainer for some of the busiest and most popular artists in the music and Hollywood Industry, such as Kanye West, Kim, Khloe, and Kourtney Kardashian.
