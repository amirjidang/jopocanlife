Both workout studios have floor-to-ceiling windows that allow you to see straight out through the building's glass facade, but they can be fully shaded to let multi-colored lighting systems go into effect.</p><p><span class="inline text-h5 text-seafoam-dark">Related Stories</span></p><a v-on:click.prevent="trackLinkGA($event, key)" :href=post.url data-url-source=related-content class=related-content__link referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url href=#><img :src=post.image_url :alt=post.title src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/chaisefitness-new-studio-financial-district/ style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>The Core Room has 20 chairs (previously the largest studio held 13) and a multi-layered foam-cushioned floor to protect your joints, while the cycling studio has 25 bikes with lots of space between them (yay!) and a gorgeous photo print spanning the back wall of the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges from the Seaport. "We took all the design elements from the other studios, but this is definitely the most state-of-the-art," Piskin says.</p><p>The locker rooms are also super spacious and luxe, with eight showers for women and plenty of room for primping before walking to work on Wall Street.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ChaiseFitness-Fidi-2.jpg alt="Financial District spinning and Pilates" width=700 height=467 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>The workouts</strong></p><p>In addition to ChaiseFitness' popular existing classes, like <a href=# referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.wellandgood.com/2012/08/24/class-action-reinvention-chair-at-chaise-23/>Reinvention Chair </a>and <a href=# referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.wellandgood.com/2013/02/22/class-action-ballet-bungee-at-chaise-23/>Ballet Bungee</a>, the FiDi studio will offer brand-new ones, too.</p><p>I tried Chaise Bands, which is done with just a resistance band and a mat and includes sculpting and toning moves with cardio intervals. Piskin said it was a natural outgrowth of <a href=# referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.wellandgood.com/2015/01/20/3-ways-to-get-fit-using-a-dining-room-chair/>the at-home workouts she was creating</a>, which clients were responding really well to. "I wanted to create something new and fun but also a really great complement to the chair," she says. "It's a different way of moving, without the chair and bungees, but still all core- and Pilates-based." Expect challenging moves and lots of sweat, in a slightly more accessible format (AKA no piking on the chair pedal).</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ChaiseFitness-Fidi-4.jpg alt="Financial District spinning and Pilates" width=700 height=467 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Perfecting your posture while you pedal</strong></p><p>Then, of course, there's ChaisePedal, which will be offered exclusively in FiDi. While it might seem a little out of left field for the brand, Piskin says they're applying Chaise principles, like signature arm movements and core focus, to their own spin style. "We're going to focus on the posture, the technique, and bring all the elements we focus on on the chair onto the bike," she says. Which could be interesting since Chaise could really add something to the indoor cycling posture discussion.</p><p>In other words, Chaise is becoming a one-stop shop in a neighborhood that's attracting more and more fitness openings lately, like SoulCycle, <a href=# referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.wellandgood.com/2015/03/25/first-look-bfxs-new-fidi-studio-fuses-cycling-and-strength-training-in-one-sweet-room/>BFX</a>, and Pure Barre. "[We] want to offer....clients coming here as much as possible, so it can really become a gym they're coming to five times a week and they can change it up throughout," Piskin says. At this new studio, that seems like a distinct possibility. —Lisa Elaine Held</p><p><strong>ChaiseFitness Fidi, 180 Maiden Lane, 3rd Floor, Financial District, New York, NY, 10038, (212) 741-0417, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://chaisefitness.com/>chaisefitness.com</a></strong></p><p>(Photos: ChaiseFitness)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHLpZinnJekvKV6wqikaJuYlra0scWiq6edo6h6r7HWZqqtrZSevG6yyKeYp5uZlrlusMisq6uhk6l8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeff-bezos-first-trillionaire-2026.html><span>←</span><span>2026: The Year Jeff Bezos Is On Track To Become The First Trillionaire</span></a>
