In the present moment, he is with both of his daughters. Yanny further said that everyone at Lockwood is praying for Lisa Marie’s loved ones. Priscilla Presley, the singer’s mother, has confirmed her son’s death.</p><p>He was <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Elvis Presley</a> and Lisa Marie Presley’s only child. ‘It is with a sad heart that I must deliver the tragic news that my beloved daughter Lisa Marie has left us,’ the 77-year-old New Yorker wrote in a statement to People.</p><p>He said, “She was the most passionate, strong, and loving woman I have ever met. Please respect our need for space as we mourn this great loss. We appreciate your support and prayers. The company has decided not to make any additional statements at this time.</p><p>Us Weekly had earlier reported that Lisa Marie had gone into cardiac arrest and was transported to the hospital. “Michael hopes and prays that she gets better as quickly as possible so that they can do the best for their children,” Yanny told Us at the time.</p><p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Is Tyler Perry Married To His Girlfriend Gelila Bekele?</a></p><h2>Fantastic Ritual</h2><p>Everyone was really happy for them, and the ceremony was spectacular because of the venue and the company. Before the song Michael wrote for Stephanie, The Distance, a string quartet played Here Comes the Bride as Stephanie was escorted down the aisle by her father.</p><p>Tacos from Slate Catering Santa Barbara, along with drinks, beer, wine, and champagne, were served to guests at the reception, which was held at a friend’s cafe called Scarlett Begonia. According to the insider, Stephanie is about to jet out to Poland to film the biggest movie of her career, and the newlyweds have made plans to honeymoon in the region.</p><p>In December 2018, following the termination of his decade-long romance with Lisa Marie, RadarOnline reported that Michael was engaged to the hairdresser. He never thought he’d find love at such a trying period, but Stephanie has been there for him the whole way, and the two of them are completely head over heels for one other, a source said.</p><p>“Michael is a pretty conventional guy, therefore he asked for his future bride’s hand in marriage by letter to her father. The family is quite close to him and has given him their approval.”</p><p>He proposed at a romantic dinner at the Italian restaurant Pache in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, and afterward celebrated with his loved ones who had stood by him during the custody struggle.</p><h2>Surviving the Nightmare</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/unnamed-9-1024x683.webp alt="Surviving the Nightmare" width=1024 height=683 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>As the insider put it, “Michael simply wants this nightmare with Lisa to be done and for him to go on with his life, he wishes she will meet someone else and do the same.” Michael believed the $4,641 in child support awarded by the judge was not enough, so he filed a motion to increase the amount Lisa was required to pay him each month.</p><p>Besides the monthly income from her family’s fortune, Lisa is said to be living well thanks to a multimillion-dollar book contract and earnings from the wildly successful Elvis film starring Austin Butler.</p><p>Michael and his new wife are living in a modest home since he argues, he only gets a little pay as a musician compared to Lisa. According to recently released court records obtained by The United States Sun, he and Lisa resolved their dispute confidentially on October 3 in Los Angeles.</p><p>The document states, “The parties announce a complete partial settlement after meeting and discussing with the Court.” Following her divorce from Michael, her fourth marriage, Lisa, now 54, is often assumed to be single.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq5qoppyeu6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiho2K5qr%2FAZqSaqpmaerTAyKWjZqWRp7%2BqscNmq6hlnZ6wqa3EpWSlp5OgxLC7w2hocGlpbHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-are-island-boys-flyysoulja-parents-twin-kodiyakreddand-is-he-in-jail-2.html><span>←</span><span>Who Are Island Boys Flyysoulja Parents?
