In her snap, Aniston posed in the shower next to <a href=#>two bottles of her LolaVie products</a>. The brand’s Instagram account was also tagged.</p><p class=p1>After several of the<a href=#>&nbsp;</a><i><a href=#>Friends</a>&nbsp;</i>alum’s followers expressed their excitement over the upcoming news, her 55-year-old former TV beau took things up a notch.</p><p class=p1>“@jenniferaniston&nbsp;— a towel I hope??” Schwimmer captioned a Wednesday, September 7, <a href=#>Instagram</a> snap, seemingly replying to Aniston’s original message. The&nbsp;<a href=#><i>American Crime Story&nbsp;</i></a>alum, for his part, posed in his shower mid-shampoo.</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Marley & Me&nbsp;</i>actress soon caught onto Schwimmer’s joke, “liking” his snap before adding a comment of her own.&nbsp;“Schwim!? Trying to steal my thunder!?&nbsp;<span class=s1>🤨❤️</span>,” Aniston replied.</p><p class=p1>Schwimmer and Aniston <a href=#>played Ross Geller and Rachel Green, respectively, on all ten seasons</a> of&nbsp;<i>Friends</i>, which aired from 1994 to 2004.

We respected that.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Cake&nbsp;</i>star, for her part, noted during the reunion special that <a href=#>her costar’s feelings were reciprocated</a> and that she held out brief hope for an offscreen romance.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I remember saying one time to David, ‘It’s gonna be such a bummer if the first time you and I actually kiss is going to be on national television,’” she recalled at the time. “Sure enough, the first time we kissed was in that coffee shop. We just channeled all of our adoration and love for each other into Ross and Rachel.”</p><p class=p1>While Aniston never acted any further on her romantic feelings for Schwimmer, she went on to marry<a href=#><strong> Brad Pitt</strong></a> in 2000 before <a href=#>their eventual divorce in 2005.</a> The&nbsp;<i>Horrible Bosses&nbsp;</i>actress later wed <a href=#><strong>Justin Theroux</strong></a> in 2015 before <a href=#>calling it quits three years later</a>.
