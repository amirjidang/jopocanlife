According to Lake Lanier's own site ... "Buford Dam produces hydo-electric power for surrounding counties. Tubes continuously pass water through the dam at a minimum rate of 600 cubic feet per second (CFS)." Lastly ... officials have actually told people to swim in Lake Lanier at their own risk of late -- as this body of water has caused upwards of 700 deaths dating back to the '50s.</p><ul class="social social--permalink"><li class="social__item social__item--3items"><a class="btn social__btn social__btn--facebook js-track-link" href=# onclick='return window.open("http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tmz.com%2F2023%2F07%2F30%2Fman-dies-electrocution-jumping-into-lake-lanier%2F%3Fadid%3Dshare-fb","_blank","status=0,width=575,height=450"),!1' data-node-ref=tmz:article:0f26a784-ee97-4a46-9af3-342eda79e033 data-context='{"section":"main","name":"facebook-footer","pos":1}'><span class="icon icon-lg icon-facebook--white social__icon--facebook"></span> Share<span class=social__hide-sm> on Facebook</span></a></li><li class="social__item social__item--3items"><a class="btn social__btn social__btn--twitter js-track-link" href=# onclick='return window.open("https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tmz.com%2F2023%2F07%2F30%2Fman-dies-electrocution-jumping-into-lake-lanier%2F%3Fadid%3Dshare-tw&text=Man%20Dies%20by%20Electrocution%20After%20Jumping%20Into%20Lake%20Lanier&via=TMZ&related=HarveyLevinTMZ","_blank","status=0,width=575,height=450"),!1' data-node-ref=tmz:article:0f26a784-ee97-4a46-9af3-342eda79e033 data-context='{"section":"main","name":"twitter-footer","pos":2}'><span class="icon icon-lg icon-twitter--white social__icon--twitter"></span> TWEET<span class=social__hide-sm> This</span></a></li></ul><h3 class="card-section-title related-articles__card-section-title">related articles</h3><a class="related-articles__card-link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=tmz:article:0f26a784-ee97-4a46-9af3-342eda79e033 data-context='{"section":"main","name":"related-article","pos":1}'><img width=300 height=169 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/imagez.tmz.com/image/b3/16by9/2012/07/08/b381dc75e4005b7e9aae369875dfdab7_xs.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4 class=related-articles__card-title>Usher's Stepson Declared Brain Dead by Doctors After Jet Ski Accident</h4></a><a class="related-articles__card-link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=tmz:article:0f26a784-ee97-4a46-9af3-342eda79e033 data-context='{"section":"main","name":"related-article","pos":2}'><img width=300 height=169 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/imagez.tmz.com/image/b2/16by9/2012/07/08/b2070d7f35d85e3db036b2b46fb2a1ed_xs.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4 class=related-articles__card-title>Usher's Stepson -- Investigation Into Accident Underway</h4></a><ul class=tag-cloud__list-group><a class="tag-cloud__list-group-item js-track-link" href=# data-context='{"section":"main","name":"tag-cloud","pos":1}'>RIP</a> <a class="tag-cloud__list-group-item js-track-link" href=# data-context='{"section":"main","name":"tag-cloud","pos":2}'>Viral</a> <a class="tag-cloud__list-group-item js-track-link" href=# data-context='{"section":"main","name":"tag-cloud","pos":3}'>News</a></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbnZZ5qopV9nfXN%2FjmluaGtgZLqiuoydoJ6rXZq5pq%2FTq6acraSevK95ya6kqaGenHqqutOoZKWZm5p6ra3NopyrZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jason-varitek.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Jason Varitek dating?
