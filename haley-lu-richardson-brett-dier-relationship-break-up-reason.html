More often than not cast in supporting roles, Richardson is <a href=#>incredibly adept at sharing the screen with Hollywood's biggest stars</a>.Somehow able to hold her own with whoever she acts with while at the same time holding her co-stars up, audiences can't help but be drawn in by Richardson's performances. For that reason and the fact that <a href=#>she has some marvelous opinions about her role</a>, it makes perfect sense that Richardson joined <a href=#>White Lotus season 2's incredible cast</a>.Even though there is no doubt that Richardson's career already is incredible, the truth is that she isn't an A-list actor yet. For that reason, the paparazzi and the tabloids haven't become obsessed with Richardson yet as they are with some of her peers. One of the side effects of Richardson's relative anonymity is that many of her fans don't know that much about her personal life. Most notably, they don't know the details of Richardson's relationship with the actor Brett Dier or why they split up...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-serious-was-haley-lu-richardson-s-relationship-with-brett-dier>How Serious Was Haley Lu Richardson's Relationship With Brett Dier?</h2><p>Just like most actors, fans have gotten the chance to see Haley Lu Richardson portray several characters who are falling in and out of love. In real life, however, there has only been one person she has been linked to in public from the moment that Richardson rose to fame.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Many Spin-offs Does 'Pretty Little Liars' Have?</a></span></p><p>Since the show Pretty Little Liars was a huge hit, it has spawned several spin-offs to date. During the early-2010s, one of those spin-offs titled Ravenswood aired and despite the network having high hopes for the series, it was soon canceled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/haley-lu-richardson-and-brett-dier.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During Ravenswood's short run, the show starred the actor Brett Dier and featured Richardson in a supporting role. After working together on the mostly forgotten series, Richardson and Dier eventually fell in love, became a couple for several years, and seemed to have a very playful relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/haley-lu-richardson-and-brett-dier-goofing-around.jpg><p>In 2019, Richardson was interviewed by Cosmopolitan and she told the adorable story about how she wound up proposing to Dier.</p><p>Most of the time when people propose to their partner, they put a lot of time and effort into planning the event. Unlike many people who look for the perfect place to propose, it turns out that Richardson chose the most unassuming of locations.</p><p>"We were at this outdoor strip mall eating pizza when it happened."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While that may seem surprising, it actually makes perfect sense when you learn how quickly Richardson decided to propose. According to Richardson, not only did she not have an elaborate plan for how she was going to pop the big question, <a href=#>she asked Dier to marry her on a whim</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>White Lotus Star Haley Lu Richardson Has A Complicated Relationship With Her Looks</a></span></p><p>"Here’s the thing. I didn’t prepare at all. I had no idea when I woke up that morning that I was going to ask someone to marry me that day."</p><p>"I was totally in the moment and this gut feeling came up and coerced me to ask him to marry me and I did. And he said yes. I feel like the trick to that was just not thinking about it at all before it happened. I just kind of did it."</p><p>Richardson then went on to describe what happened next after she popped the question.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/haley-lu-richardson-and-brett-dier-on-the-red-carpet.jpg><p>"When we were crying and having this really amazing moment that I’ll never forget, crying and holding each other and saying oh my gosh, we’re going to get married, we’re going to be together forever, we were like, we’re gonna have to do something about it because we didn’t have any rings."</p><p>"So we went over to this bush and got these twigs and each knelt down one at a time and tied these twigs around our ring fingers. We have them saved in a little baggie. My engagement ring now, it’s custom made, it’s a really simple ring but it’s engraved like a twig."</p><p>Finally, Richardson finished talking about the day she and Dier got engaged by describing how she felt at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It was just the best day ever. It’s the best my heart has ever felt. I never knew my heart could feel that good."</p><h2 id=when-did-haley-lu-richardson-and-brett-dier-split-up>When Did Haley Lu Richardson And Brett Dier Split Up?</h2><p>Knowing how Haley Lu Richardson felt after she proposed to Brett Dier about their twig engagement rings, it is hard not to root for the couple. Sadly, however, Dier and Richardson weren't able to make things work, and they eventually split up.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Celebs Who Called Off Their Weddings Last Minute</a></span></p><p>Since it seems clear that Richardson and Dier were in love, it shouldn't surprise anyone that their split seems to have been hard for the couple. When Dier and Richardson announced they weren't together in November 2022, they also revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they'd actually broken up two years earlier</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While other celebrity couples have announced their splits with a press statement, Richardson posted a photo of herself with Dier on Instagram with a caption revealing the news.</p><p>“Hey guys. This is me and Brett. We actually separated two years ago. But life goes on and we are both existing and doing pretty well turns out. We shared a deeply special chunk of our lives together I’m so glad to have had the last couple years to heal and grow without the internet knowing but we kinda just wanted to share it and move on now. Love yourselves! Life is life babies!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/haley-lu-richardson-and-brett-dier.jpg><p>Just like Richardson, Dier wrote about their relationship ending on Instagram at the same time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We separated 2 years ago but we saw each other today for the first time. We are happy and so thankful for the time we had together. (For those people who have been dying to know what happened to us) Haley's post is better worded so go read that one! Have a great day!"</p><p>To date, neither Richardson nor Dier have revealed what led to their split but one thing they've both made very clear is that they care deeply about each other.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifmqSVrnqtwYyroJygkaextLvNZpmrnaSpeqW1xKtkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXZe%2Fpq3KZqypZaKarrS7zWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./walmart-black-friday-deals.html><span>←</span><span>Walmart's Black Friday Deals Are Live Limited Quantities</span></a>
