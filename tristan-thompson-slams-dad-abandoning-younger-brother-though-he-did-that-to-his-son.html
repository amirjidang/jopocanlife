Trevor Douglas Thompson was ordered to pay child support to Andrea Marie Brooks as a result of the same proceeding which granted Andrea Brooks sole custody,” the court documents state. “Since then, Trevor Douglas Thompson has effectively abandoned the proposed ward; he failed to pay any child support despite the court order and has not been in contact with the [Amari] or Andrea Marie Brooks since July 2014.”</p><p>They added, “[Trevor] has done nothing to support or raise the proposed ward since then and has relinquished all rights to have any say in the proposed ward's care.”</p><p>Maralee Nichols, the woman whom Tristan shares his youngest child with, has been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vocal about the fact that the NBA star doesn’t want a relationship</a> with their son.
