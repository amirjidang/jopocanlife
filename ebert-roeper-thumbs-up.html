But beyond their simple <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">thumbs up and thumbs down review system</a>, it was their consistent opinions and admiration for cinema, their ability to create their own art while reflecting on the art of others, that made them timeless icons. One of the most successful elements of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">At The Movies</a>, their weekly review program hosted on the ABC network, was their ability to disagree while maintaining valid opinions and on-the-nose commentaries. The duo became an iconic pairing, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Statler and Waldorf </a>of the film world, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rosencrantz and Gildenstern</a> of Hollywood.</p><p>Though Roeper was a later edition after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the passing of Gene Siskel</a>, Roeper was able to stand out through his preference of political films and his admiration for the sometimes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">seedier underbelly of cinema</a>. Together, the duo was much more calculated and friendly than the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">famous rivalry and heated opinions</a> of Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, but together, the duo managed to comment on some of the most popular and influential films of cinema. Through their love of journalism, their ability to pin-point perfection, and their passion for film itself, the duo was able to create one of the most iconic review shows in both film and television history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=journalistic-journey>Journalistic Journey</h2><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>21 Of Roger Ebert's Most Hated Movies</a></span></p><p>Roger Ebert was born in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Urbana, Illinois</a> and throughout his career, he was known and admired for retaining his Mark Twain-esque midwestern voice that made him one of the more relatable critics in film history. He started his career in journalism while still in high school while he worked for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The News-Gazette</a> in Champaign, Illinois and later as a reporter for the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Illini</a>. After earning his master’s degree in English from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Cape Town</a>, he was accepted as a PhD student at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Chicago</a>. While earning his doctorate, he earned a job with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Sun-Times in 1966</a>, a move that would sustain his entire career along with a lifetime’s worth of cinema reviews. He gained recognition for several early reviews of genre-establishing horror films which included one for Night of the Living Dead which managed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">find its way into an issue of reader’s digest</a>. He then started to work in cinema directly, co-writing the feature film <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond the Valley of the Dolls</a>, Up!, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens</a>. In 1975, he was awarded the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulitzer Prize for Criticism.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Roeper followed a similar journalistic trajectory. Born in Chicago, he attended <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Illinois State University</a> where he earned his degree in Journalism. He first started working for the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Sun-Times in 1987</a> and covered a variety of topics ranging from politics to media and entertainment. He also gained recognition as an author and published several books on controversial topics including Urban Legends and Conspiracy Theories. These included: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Urban Legends: The Truth Behind All Those Delightfully Persistent Myths of Films, Television, and Music</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Debunked! Conspiracy Theories, Urban Legends, and Evil Plots of the 21st Century</a>. He gained further attention through radio and television appearances on programs like the Howard Stern Show, The Tonight Show, and The O’Reilly Factor, the latter of which earned him several Emmys.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=defining-cinema>Defining Cinema</h2><p>Both Ebert and Roeper had a unique way of defining cinema. While their weekly reviews often consisted of whatever films were being released, they would also create unique <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">end-of-year and end-of-decade lists</a> that could prioritize some of the greatest advancements, successes, and monumental moments in film throughout the years and decades. A majority of their lists have withstood the test of time. Ebert had selected Apocalypse Now as his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">favorite film of 1979</a> and predicted the career of both Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman by highlighting <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Being John Malkovich</a> in 1999 and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Synecdoche, New York</a> in 2008. Roeper has also solidified his reputation at selecting timeless films as well, choosing to highlight <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Departed </a>in 2006, Inception in 2010, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Boyhood</a> in 2014. But while many of their picks fall into the timeless relevance and importance of film history, several other picks seem to stand out as overlooks of the time. Ebert once stated his regret of picking Scenes from a Marriage in 1974 over Polanski’s Chinatown, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spoke about similar regret</a> when he ranked Small Change above Taxi Driver in 1976. Roeper had similar reflections throughout his career as well, selecting lesser known films as his favorite of the year like Brothers in 2009 and In America in 2003.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=passion-for-the-theater>Passion for the Theater</h2><p>Beyond all disagreements, differing views, or cinema speculations, one thing both Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper had in common was their love of cinema. Both dedicated their lives to reviewing movies and creating their own art out of their responses to other people's works. Their ability to shape the culture and lend a guiding hand to audiences across the world helped to introduce a wide range of movies to a diverse group of audiences. When Roger Ebert <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">passed away from cancer in 2013</a>, he was memorialized by some of the most prevalent members of culture. President <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barack Obama stated</a>, “Movies won’t be the same without Roger.” A variety of other critically-acclaimed directors spoke of his honor as well including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christopher Nolan</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin Scorsese</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steven Spielberg</a>. Throughout Ebert’s career, he won <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">several critic awards</a> as well including a Directors Guild of America Award as an Honorary Life Member, a Pulitzer Prize for Criticism, and two Chicago Emmy Awards in 2005 and 1979.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Richard Roeper is also known for his recognition throughout film culture. He has hosted programs with acclaimed directors including <a href=#>Kevin Smith</a>, Aisha Taylor, and <a href=#>Jay Leno</a>. He continues to work as a journalist for the Chicago Sun-Times publication, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">writing entertainment articles</a> ranging from newly released films to debuting television programs. His recent reviews have revolved around a critique of <a href=#>M. Night. Shyamalan</a>’s latest film Old and a positive preview of the <a href=#>Val Kilmer</a> documentary. His recent list of favorite films from 2021 so far have included A Quiet Place Part II, The Water Man, Nobody, No Sudden Move, In the Heights, and Cruella. He has also continued his career through his work as a film critic for ABC-7’s “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Windy City Live</a>”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper have shaped a culture of criticism that has spawned audience endorsed websites like Rotten Tomatoes and MetaCritic. Their ability to create controversial stances on cinema has also inspired audience-driven apps like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Letterboxd</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taste</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Itcher</a>. And now, in a world where everyone considers themselves a critic with sites like Yelp, the true value of a cultural commentator is starting to lose its prestige. But through articulate and engaging reviews, all disguised under the binary code of a thumbs up / thumbs down approach, both Ebert and Roeper were able to contribute a vast amount of passion and influence into the film industry, more than any director, auteur, or screenwriter could offer themselves.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>8 Great Movies that got Terrible Reviews</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Time</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ChicagoTribune</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AustinChronicle</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ScreenRant</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NYTimes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Biography</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RogerEbert</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SunSigns</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">UniversityofIllinois</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulitzer</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ChicagoSunTimes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WSJ</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSyo7HRrWSrp5WlsrN506GsppqjYsKxew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./drew-barrymore-through-the-years-from-child-star-to-hollywood-vet-w476344.html><span>←</span><span>Drew Barrymore Through the Years: Photos</span></a>
