The Victoria's Secret model, who married Adam Levine in 2014, has found herself in a sticky situation involving her husband and a young Instagram model, with whom he allegedly had an affair with. All around the world, fans have been left disgusted by the shocking news, slandering Adam and his mistress online, taking no time to drag the shady pair through the mud. However, aside from his latest scandal, Adam is also best known for his role as a member of the pop-rock band Maroon 5.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Behati Prinsloo Was Brutally Bashed Over Adam Levine's Outrageous Face Tattoo">Behati Prinsloo Was Brutally Bashed Over Adam Levine's Outrageous Face Tattoo</a></span></p><p>The singer joined the reformed band in 2001, where he began to rise to fame. His highly successful journey as a music artist has left him with a whopping net worth of an estimated $160 million. Considering he has a large net worth, many fans have been left wondering how much his current wife, Behati Prinsloo is worth without the band member.</p><h2 id=who-is-behati-prinsloo>Who Is Behati Prinsloo?</h2><p>First and foremost, who exactly is Behati Prinsloo? Despite the model's name dancing all over recent news headlines, some fans of the Maroon 5 band member and members of the public alike are still unsure of who exactly she is.</p><p><a href=#>Behati Prinsloo was born in South Africa</a> in 1988 and grew up attending school in the country. At the young age of 16, she was spotted by a modeling agency during a visit to Cape Town with her grandparents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This revelation would eventually lead to Prinsloo dropping out of school and signing with the agency, marking the start of what would become a highly successful modeling career.</p><p>Since becoming a model, she has become best known for her work as a Victoria's Secret lingerie model and often appeared in their fashion shows between the years 2007 and 2015. Another highlight from her career was being the face of Victoria's Secret PINK line in 2008, as well as becoming an 'Angel' the proceeding year.</p><p>She has also appeared on the face of several highly-established fashion magazines, such as Vogue, GQ, and Elle. Her highly successful career has allowed her to establish a name for herself within the industry and has allowed her to mix with a large pool of A-List celebrities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="What Happened Between Adam Levine And Lady Gaga?">What Happened Between Adam Levine And Lady Gaga?</a></span></p><p>Despite having a highly successful career, it's not been all rainbows and sunshine for the modeling icon. As mentioned earlier, recent headlines have been bashing both <a href=#>Adam Levine and the controversial LA model that he allegedly had an affair with</a>.</p><p>Despite the scandal, it appears as though <a href=#>Prinsloo is staying loyal to the father of her children</a>. She's 'worth' plenty on her own, though.</p><h2 id=behati-prinsloo-has-a-net-worth-of-30-million>Behati Prinsloo Has A Net Worth Of $30 Million</h2><p><a href=#>Adam Levine and Behati Prinsloo live together in a $32 million mansion</a>, where they are currently raising a child together. The large net worth of the Maroon 5 band member is likely the reason that the couple can afford to live in such a luxe pad.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Behati Prinsloo's net worth clocks in at a total of $30 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Much of Prinsloo's income likely comes from her highly successful career as a model, alongside potential brand deals and online sponsorships. In fact, she is reportedly one of the highest-paid models in the world.</p><p>She also earns money for walking runway shows, which can pay, and working with other big brands such as Chanel and Ralph Lauren will have likely boosted her income further. It's possible she also earns income from social media, as many models and influencers do through product partnerships.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="The Story Behind Adam Levine, Behati Prinsloo And Nina Agdal's Love Triangle">The Story Behind Adam Levine, Behati Prinsloo And Nina Agdal's Love Triangle</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If the couple combined their earnings, they would be worth a total of $192 million — a staggering amount. As the pair currently live together, it is likely that they spend the money to fund their luxurious lifestyle, as well as on their two (soon to be three) children.</p><h2 id=it-isn-39-t-clear-if-the-couple-has-a-prenuptial-agreement>It Isn't Clear If The Couple Has a Prenuptial Agreement</h2><p>As of writing, there is currently minimal information regarding whether Prinsloo and Adam have a prenuptial agreement. If they do, both sides' net worths may be preserved if a separation did occur.</p><p>If there isn't a prenup, it's possible that Adam could stand to lose a significant amount of his net worth via spousal support and child support.</p><p>For now, though, Behati seems to be standing by her man, so there's no reason to assume she's been counting up her accounts to see how she would make it on her own. Though if she needed to, she'd clearly have no problem doing so!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecGen5qsmWK9s7XNrKOop12jsrV51qipraBf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./giveon-bet-awards-performance-lie-again-1234671417.html><span>←</span><span>Givon Performs &amp;quot;Lie Again&amp;quot; At 2022 BET Awards Following Mic Mishap</span></a>
