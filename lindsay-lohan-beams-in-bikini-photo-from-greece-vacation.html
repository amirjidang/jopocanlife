The <a href=#><span class=s2>Irish Wish</span></a> star added three selfies to the carousel — she wears white shades in two, her famous red hair flowing. Other serene shots show a view of Mykonos from an airplane window and the pool from her hotel, the ocean in the distance. Lohan <span>— who <a href=#>gave birth</a> to her first child with husband <strong>Bader Shammas</strong> in June 2023 — </span></span><span class=s1>apparently had seafood for dinner one night, as evidenced by the fish dish she posted.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Recently…” she captioned her post.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“VACAY BABY!!!” wrote Lohan’s former <a href=#><span class=s2><i>Freaky Friday</i></span></a> costar, <strong>Jamie Lee Curtis</strong>, in the comments, while <strong>Garcelle Beauvais</strong> wrote, “Beautiful.” <strong>Paris Hilton</strong> left a simple heart emoji.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Lohan was clearly happy to take a break following a busy period of work. After years out of the public eye, Lohan has made a major acting comeback in recent years with the rom-coms <i>Falling for Christmas</i> and <i>Irish Wish</i>, which are part of her creative partnership with Netflix. Her <a href=#><span class=s2>third movie</span></a> for the streaming service, <i>Our Little Secret</i>, arrives during the holiday season and&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>follows two exes who are forced to spend Christmas under the same roof — unfortunately, their&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>current partners are siblings.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Earlier this month, a source <a href=#>exclusively revealed to <i>Us Weekly </i></a>that Lohan has received Ann-Margret’s blessing to play her in a biopic. The insider noted that the pair will be spending time together in preparation for the upcoming film.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Lohan has wanted to play Ann-Margret for years.&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>In April, she told <a href=#><span class=s2><i>Bustle</i> </span></a>that she was looking for the “right writer” for the film. “She’s a triple threat, and she’s an amazing woman on top of that,” she said of the </span><span class=s1><i>Bye Bye Birdie</i> actress and singer, 83. </span><span class=s1>“So I just really want to do her justice and help tell a great story for her.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Lohan, the insider told <i>Us</i>, “feels she’s the only one who can play the part” and “wants to win an Oscar and an Emmy.” She hopes that the biopic can “take her career to the next level.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Meanwhile, the sequel to her 2003 hit<a href=#><span class=s2> Freaky Friday</span></a> is in the works, with Curtis and Lohan playing mother and daughter once again —&nbsp;and this time around, Lohan’s Anna <a href=#>is a mom</a> to her own snarky teen daughter, named Harper.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Along with her growing work schedule, Lohan is balancing new motherhood after welcoming son Luai with husband <strong>Bader Shammas</strong> in July 2023.
