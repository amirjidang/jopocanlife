One could only imagine the special effects that went into this movie, costing a total budget of $110 million.

Johnson's character is Luke Hobbs, a brawny Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent who is sent to Rio, Brazil to arrest Dom (Vin Diesel), Brian (Paul Walker), and Mia (Jordanna Brewster) for the murder of DEA Agents.

The film's predecessor was The Fate of the Furious, which grossed a whopping $1.2 million at the box office. However, against a budget of $200 million, Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw still managed to gross $760.7 million worldwide with less than half the original cast!</p><p>Both actors were in prior Fast and Furious films, and both were paid handsomely for their respective roles.

But as the franchise grew, so did the film's budget to accommodate the actor's salary. According to SportsKeeda, by the time Fast and Furious 7 was released, his salary increased to $15 million, which is still less than he received for Hobbs and Shaw.</p><h2 id=dwayne-johnson-39-s-furious-7-made-1-5-billion><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Dwayne Johnson's Furious 7 Made $1.5 billion</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DJ-interview.png><ul><li>Actor salary: $15 million</li><li>Instagram: 391 million followers</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Furious 7 may have been a bitter-sweet moment for Dwyane "The Rock" Johnson because it would be Paul Walker's final film role following his death, but it would also be Johnson's first salary increase since starring in the movie. Considering the fact that they shot certain scenes in Abu Dhabi, the budget cost seems justified. But the money invested was quickly regained, as BBC reported that Furious 7 broke the $1 billion barrier worldwide in just seven days, making it the fastest film to generate that figure so quickly.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/luke-hobbs-fast-and-furious.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Dwayne Johnson's Fast & Furious Character Was Originally Completely Different With An Older Actor Set For The Role</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Dwayne Johnson was very different from the actor who almost played Luke Hobbs in Fast and Furious.</span><p>A large part of the reason why Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is able to ask for multi-million-dollar acting checks is because of his massive social media following.
