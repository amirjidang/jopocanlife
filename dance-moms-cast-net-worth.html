Focusing on young competitive dancers -- and their bickering mothers -- Dance Moms is a perfect mixture of cheesy drama and genuine skill. The show premiered in 2011 and has seen so much success it is still airing to this day. Alumni of the show have gone on to have impressive careers in show business, and the little girls who&nbsp;were once known solely for their dance abilities have since racked in the dough as full-time entertainers. Here are ten of the richest members of the cast.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Richest Reality Show Stars Of 2019</a></span></p><h2 id=hyland-sisters---250k>Hyland Sisters - $250k</h2><p>Though this entree technically makes this a list of eleven people, Brooke and Paige Hyland&nbsp;are both said to have a matching net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$250,000</a>. Older sister Brooke was once the go-to acrobatic girl, but has since dabbled with a music career and has released various singles.

As for Paige, the dancer took up volleyball after leaving the show.&nbsp;She graduated high school this year and just started school at West Virginia University.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ava-michelle---900k>Ava Michelle - $900k</h2><p>Ava Michelle, also known as Ava Cota, was never an official member of the Abby Lee dance team, but still managed to acquire a promising career despite the&nbsp;initial rejection she received on the show. Ava went on to release two singles, score a guest role on the soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful, and star in multiple short films. It was just this year that Ava may have gotten her big break, starring in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a> hit movie Tall Girl. Though she was teased for her height on Dance Moms, she's now using her body type to her advantage! In addition, she has a clothing line called “AVA X JMS." As of now, her net worth is $900,000.</p><h2 id=kalani-hilliker---1-million>Kalani Hilliker - $1 million</h2><p>Kalani Hilliker had already made some moves in the entertainment industry before even appearing on Dance Moms!

As of now, her net worth is around $1 million.</p><h2 id=kendall-vertes---1-5-million>Kendall Vertes - $1.5 million</h2><p>A large part of Dance Moms focused on the girls pursuing other ventures outside of dance, such as Kendall Vertes and her music career. Performing under the name "Kendall K," she released&nbsp;various singles and music videos. Kendall's popularity has also scored her other opportunities, such as releasing an Emoji app called "Kendall KMoji" and collaborating with Target for a clothing line. Though she&nbsp;may have one foot still in the entertainment industry, she lives a more low-key life now. She's currently focusing on finishing up high school and playing on the golf team. Her current net worth is $1.5 million.</p><h2 id=nia-sioux-frazier---1-5-million>Nia Sioux Frazier - $1.5 million</h2><p>Though Nia Frazier often had to fight for the spotlight on Dance Moms, she has all eyes on her now!

Then, she was diagnosed with a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cancer called Burkitt lymphoma,&nbsp;which severely impaired her spine.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Reality TV Stars Who Have Seen The Inside Of A Jail Cell</a></span></p><p>Though she's still learning to walk again after her medical issues, Abby jumped at the chance to return to Dance Moms after being declared cancer-free. As of now, she's back on the show with a net worth of $2 million.</p><h2 id=mackenzie-ziegler---3-million>Mackenzie Ziegler - $3 million</h2><p>Mackenzie was once the littlest on the dance team, but now is one of the biggest names from the show. She's appeared in the sitcom Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn, starred in the web series Total Eclipse, competed on Dancing With The Stars: Juniors, and modeled for Polo Ralph Lauren. Her name is mainly known for her steadily growing music career, however. Her first album, Mack Z, went #1 on the iTunes pop chart! She just released her second full-length album, Phases, and signed with Arista Records. Along with brand deals, the release of a self-help book, a cosmetic line, and various clothing lines, it's no wonder her net worth is $3 million!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=maddie-ziegler---5-million>Maddie Ziegler - $5 million</h2><p>The older sister of Mackenzie, Maddie was considered Abby's "favorite" on Dance Moms.

She's also appeared on many television shows and even appeared in the&nbsp;feature film The Book of Henry. Up next, Maddie is set to star as Velma in&nbsp;Steven Spielberg's upcoming remake of <i>West Side Story.&nbsp;</i>With tons of brand deals and modeling gigs, Maddie's net worth of $5 million is no surprise.</p><h2 id=chloe-lukasiak---6-million>Chloe Lukasiak - $6 million</h2><p>While Chloe was often pitted against Maddie during her tenure on Dance Moms, her subsequent career is comparison-free. Chloe has appeared in numerous music videos and has had tons of modeling opportunities.&nbsp;She's mainly made a name for herself in the acting world, however, appearing in the Lifetime TV movie Center Stage: On Pointe and starring in the film Cowgirl's Story. Chloe has released a fashion line, a Christmas fashion line, and a shoe line.&nbsp;She also released a book and partnered with Playtex Sport.
