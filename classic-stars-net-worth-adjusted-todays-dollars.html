She was an international star in the 20’s and 30’s and was nominated for an Academy Award three times for Best Actress. Though she retired early at 35, Garbo starred in at least 28 films and fans remember her as one of the leading actresses of her time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cary-grant-130-million>Cary Grant – $130 million</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> calls Grant “the George Clooney of his time”. Handsome and charismatic, Grant had every woman swooning in films like “An Affair to Remember” and “Bringing Up Baby”. At the age of 82, Grant passed away in 1986 and had a net worth of $60 million, but with 74 films under his belt and classics that have been remade time and time again, his net worth with inflation was nearly double.</p><h2 id=audrey-hepburn-100-million>Audrey Hepburn – $100 million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She’s the reason women feel the need to have a little black dress in their closet and sparked fashion trends over decades however, her classic films may be what most remember today. “Roman Holiday”, “Funny Face” and “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” all bring back memories of laughter and references to Eliza Doolittle. Receiving dozens of award nominations, Hepburn brought home one Oscar and two Golden Globes. She died in 1993 at the age of 63.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Audrey Hepburn's Most Expensive Haute Couture</a></span></p><h2 id=katharine-hepburn-30-million>Katharine Hepburn – $30 million</h2><p>The iconic movie star was known for her no-nonsense approach and brutal honesty; however, she was also named the greatest female star of Classic Hollywood Cinema by the American Film Institute. With classic films like “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner”, “On Golden Pond” and her hits with Cary Grant, “Bringing Up Baby” and “The Philadelphia Story”, Hepburn’s tendency for privacy and staying out of the limelight didn’t diminish her value on the big screen. Hepburn passed away in 2003 at 96 years old.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=george-randolph-scott-220-million>George Randolph Scott – $220 million</h2><p>The star had several hits including “Go West, Young Man” with Mae West and “Follow the Fleet” with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, but the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlotte Museum</a> says Scott’s main forte were westerns and was among Hollywood’s top ten box office draws in the western genre.

Scott died in 1987 at the age of 89.</p><h2 id=doris-day-200-million>Doris Day – $200 million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She charmed America with her girl-next-door persona. Among other blond icons of her time, such as Marilyn Monroe, Grace Kelly and Jayne Mansfield, Day held the spot for approachable, sweet and down to earth. A near cult following, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a> has allowed her signature style as singer, actress and animal activist to propel and continue after her death in 2019 at the age of 97.</p><h2 id=mary-pickford-131-million>Mary Pickford – $131 million</h2><p>Alongside the famous Charlie Chaplin, Pickford was the highest paid actress in silent film. Pickford was on the stage since the early age of seven. At the dawn of motion pictures, she was poised to become a Hollywood icon and was the first movie star to steal the cover of the New York Dramatic Mirrors according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Women Film Pioneers</a>. She received an Academy Award for Best Actress in her first sound role, “Coquette” and her quick rise to stardom allowed her to negotiate unheard-of salaries at the time.
