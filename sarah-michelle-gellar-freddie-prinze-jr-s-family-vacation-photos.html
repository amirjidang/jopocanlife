In addition to family photos with daughter Charlotte, 12, and son Rocky, 9, the New York native snapped bathing suit selfies and beach shots.</p><p>“OK. I’m so jealous,” Gellar’s Cruel Intentions costar <a href=#><strong>Selma Blair</strong></a> commented on the post. “A vacation in paradise. I want to go. With you. Hehehhe.”</p><p>The family of four’s vacation mode was “definitely activated” in the final week of December 2021, Gellar first wrote via Instagram. The <a href=#>Buffy the Vampire Slayer </a>alum joked that her doctor had “prescribed vitamin sea” as she documented her outings with Prinze Jr., 45.</p><p>“Wishing everyone a great last day of 2021,” the Stirring Up Fun With Food author wrote alongside a New Year’s Eve selfie with her Scooby-Doo costar. “But can we all pls agree to see the terms and conditions before we agree to 2022?!?” To kick off the holiday, she subsequently “swung into 2022” on a zip line.</p><p>While the couple keep their kids’ faces covered with emojis on social media, they’ve been open about their parenting style over the years.</p><p>“<a href=#>We are strict as hell</a>,” Prinze Jr. exclusively told Us Weekly last month. “Look, I don’t believe in whooping kids. I’ve never whooped mine. My mom whooped me. They were, like, preventative whooping, so I know how to be strict. Sarah knows how to be strict.”</p><p>The Los Angeles native added in December 2021 that he has “100 rules” for Charlotte and Rocky, explaining, “They know they can’t break [those]. … Friendships come and go. I tell my kids all the time that family is forever. So we have rules and they’ve gotta follow [them].”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The She’s All That star’s comments came nearly two years after Gellar told Us that <a href=#>the couple’s parenting expectations are “higher than most.”</a></p><p>The former soap star said in February 2020 that the little ones are “not allowed” to have social media accounts, saying, “That is a huge responsibility. … My son doesn’t care. My daughter is definitely curious, but we’ve explained that these are our rules and different families have different rules. I think [our children] know what the rules are. We have [family dinner] as many nights as we can. We have no phones at the table. We sit, we all have dinner together.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see the pair’s Hawaii vacation with their children, from epic meals to beach walks</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkwKK%2BwKFkpqGTnbKtuMRmnp6knJa%2FbrLRnpudoZVivbO1zbOcZqKiYsBussCmoKWxXauupK3ToqanZaCdvLW70mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sara-foster-net-worth-2.html><span>←</span><span>Sara Foster Net Worth How Much is Foster Worth?</span></a>
