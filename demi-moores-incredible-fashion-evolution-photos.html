With tight curls that were trendy at the time and a bold red lip, her glam for the evening couldn’t have been a bigger departure from her present day straight and sleek glass hair.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>As for the fashion? She wore a mermaid-style lilac dress complete with a lace bodice. She went so far as to pair the dress with matching gloves.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>By the time the early 2000s rolled around, Moore had clearly developed a recognizable style, opting for classic black dresses and pant suits that either were made with panels of sheer fabric, had plunging necklines or showed off her decolletage.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>While timeless options remain her go-to, the Indecent Proposal star has started to throw a bit of funky fashion into the mix. At the 2016 LACMA Film + Art Gala for example, she stunned in a Gucci dress that featured embroidered roses along the neckline and bright red puff shoulders.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The following year, she took a page out of the same playbook, wearing a fabulous floral-print Gucci suit with pops of pink and green to the Blind premiere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Moore can certainly rock a designer outfit on the red carpet, but in January, she proved that she looks just as good on the runway. For the Fendi Spring/Summer 2021 fashion show, the star walked alongside models like <a href=#><strong>Bella Hadid</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Cara&nbsp;</strong><b>Delevingne</b></a>.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“First of all, truly, it didn’t hit me until afterwards that it really was like a teenage fantasy fulfilled,” she said on<a href=#><strong> Naomi Campbell</strong></a>’s YouTube series No Filter With Naomi. “I took a moment where I thought, ‘Oh my God! I literally just walked a runway show with some of the biggest models ever.’ For me, I literally felt like a little kid.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>To see how Moore went from a fresh face in Hollywood to a red carpet regular and ~ occasional ~ runway model, keep scrolling!&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvDnqSiZZ2kvLOx0magp5uimrGqrsueZJ%2BZo522sLqMnq2opKWptrC6jKmfqKyfqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./demi-lovato-sings-rock-medley-of-hit-songs-at-2023-vmas.html><span>←</span><span>Demi Lovato Sings Rock Medley of Hit Songs at 2023 VMAs</span></a>
