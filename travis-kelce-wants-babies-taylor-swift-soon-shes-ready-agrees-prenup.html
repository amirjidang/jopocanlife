Travis has been so broody that he’s told Taylor he’s open to having kids before a wedding!”</p><p>“His fatherly instincts kick in whenever he spends time with his three young nieces,” they continued. “Travis is going to be an amazing dad.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Travis is already an uncle to his brother Jason Kelce’s three children, and he’s also been vocal about wanting children of his own, especially on his New Heights podcast. Footage resurfaced recently from an episode in which <a href=#>Travis said he wanted to find a “breeder” to have kids with</a>, alleging his mom favors his brother more because he’s given her grandkids already.</p><p>The source went on to say that Taylor is on the same page about settling down and starting a family. In fact, their shared goals for the future seem to be what’s encouraged their relationship to move so quickly.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ttweb_how-travis-kelce-handles-the-pressures-that-comes-with-dating-taylor-swift_bk_a1_v2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Travis Kelce Handles The Pressures That Come With Dating Taylor Swift</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Travis Kelce appears to be well-prepared to handle the pressures that come with dating a superstar like Taylor Swift.</span><p>“She knows starting a family is huge for Travis — that’s one of the things she loves about him,” the insider continued. “Taylor and Travis have definitely talked about how cute their babies would be. They’re still not officially engaged, but they both have babies on the brain.”</p><p>“They’d love to have twins right out of the gate — a boy and a girl would be ideal — but they’re not picky,” the insider went on. “He wants four kids, and she says three is fine.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The source even had details about the potential baby names Taylor and Travis are considering, saying he’s more open to experimenting, while the singer may prefer monikers that are more classic, saying, “Taylor’s are pretty normal while Travis has some wild ideas.”</p><h2 id=travis-may-want-kids-sooner-than-taylor-does>Travis May Want Kids Sooner Than Taylor Does</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce.jpg><p>Apparently, however, Travis may be in more of a rush that Taylor, as the source claims she’s had to tell her boyfriend to calm down.

Having a good husband and a few kids is all she’s ever dreamed of and, sooner rather than later, it’s coming true.”</p><p>This new report follows claims from earlier in the month that said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Travis had already agreed to sign a prenup</a> before marrying Taylor, who recently reached billionaire status thanks to her tour’s success. If the reports are true, it seems Travis and Taylor are wasting no time getting serious.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mmnsBut8Slmp5lp5a7tb%2BMm5iboZWoerWt2KWmq2WjrLanwIyspqimXai1pr%2BMq5yanKlirqi%2BxJ6qZqiimru2vI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./top-10-most-controversial-magazine-covers-ever.html><span>←</span><span>Top 10 Most Controversial Magazine Covers Ever</span></a>
