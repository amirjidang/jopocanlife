He attended Channelview High School, where he played offensive lineman football, and graduated in 1986, just like his boys. Later, on a scholarship, he played football and track at Howard Payne University, a Division III institution.</p><p>According to his resume from Channelview High School, he was chosen six times for the All-America track and field team and was an all-conference football lineman. In 1990, he earned a bachelor’s degree in marketing from Howard Payne.</p><p>After starting his teaching career in 1994, Hurts became an assistant football coach in 1996. Hurts took over as head football coach at Channelview High School ten years later, and he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">remains</a> on the team’s roster to this day.</p><p><span><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Kysre Gondrezick Ethnicity: Exploring the Cultural Heritage and Ethnic Background!</a></strong></span></p><h4>Jalen Hurts’ Mom: Pamela Hurts</h4><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/jalen-hurts-family-020823-1-883fcdd4c19c4342b2e9ce188cf9bb45.webp alt="jalen hurts ethnicity" width=1134 height=756 sizes="(max-width: 1134px) 100vw, 1134px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Pamela Hurts, the mother of Hurts, is employed by the Channelview (Texas) School District, along with her spouse, at least for the 2017–18 school year.</p><p>She holds a master’s in counseling in addition to a bachelor’s in business administration. She teaches math to special education students in grades 6–8 at Lance Corporal Anthony Aguirre Junior High School, according to her most recent bio.</p><p>Fans of the Eagles should also thank her for Hurts’ decision to play quarterback rather than lineman. In an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Fox 26 Houston</a> in September 2016, Averion Hurts Sr. stated as much:</p><p>“My wife, she’s the reason they’re quarterbacks. (Me) being a bigger guy, you kind of expect that, ‘OK, I’m going to have some linemen,’ and do those things. Well,&nbsp;she’s not a big woman, so she kept them slim. It’s just something that happened to pay off.”</p><p>During the 2018 college football season, Pamela Hurts made headlines when she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">discussed</a> her son’s quarterback competition with Tua Tagovailoa while both players were still enrolled at Alabama.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq5qoppyeu6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiikaGyr3nHrqmtq12awam6yJygrbFfaIR6gJdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jaime-pressly-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-108267-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jaime Pressly Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
