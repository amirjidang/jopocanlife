But still, there are some guys in the boy bands that never should have even been in the group in the first place - they just were that bad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are the cute guys in the boy bands, the talented guys, the guys that are good dancers, and so on and so on. And then there are the guys that are just plain old lame. Not everyone can be a <a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a>, a <a href=#>Nick Lachey</a>, or a <a href=#>Nick Jonas</a>. In fact, hardly anyone can. Which is why we made this list.</p><p>These are the guys that you either didn't notice when you saw them on stage, or you did notice and you looked the other way. &nbsp;Now don't feel bad for these guys - they had their moment in the sun. They basically got carried by their more talented and better-looking band mates and became millionaires. So I suppose lame is all in the eye of the beholder. Nah, what am I talking about? These guys are all ridiculously lame.</p><p>Here is TheRichest's&nbsp;list of the 15 Lamest Boy Band Members Ever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-gregory-raposo---dream-street><strong>15. Gregory Raposo - Dream Street</strong></h2><p>If you forgot all about Dream Street then welcome to the club. They were a particularly lame group of 11 to 14-year-olds who were brought together by a couple of producers looking to make a quick buck. &nbsp;The band had a couple of gold records but broke up after&nbsp;parents of the band members filed a lawsuit against the producers, &nbsp;saying that the underage band members were "exposed to booze, women, and [adult entertainment]". Well, that escalated quickly! While all of Dream Street were lame, Raposo was the worst of the bunch. He has tried to get his career going as an adult, but to no avail.</p><p></p><h2 id=14-howie-dorough---backstreet-boys><strong>14. Howie Dorough - Backstreet Boys</strong></h2><p>For a boy band you have to admit that Backstreet Boys were not all bad. &nbsp;They have sold over 130 million records making them the best selling boy band in history. With that said though, could they have done it without <a href=#>Howie</a>? Yes, without a shadow of a doubt. While he isn't actually bad looking, he does have the type of face that you just want to punch.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-niall-horan---one-direction><strong>13. Niall Horan - One Direction</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Niall</a> is a rather irritating fellow from the truly horrible band One Direction. There are many reasons to think Niall is lame but just a couple are that his band signed with <a href=#>Simon Cowell</a>, and that he recently got dumped by<a href=#> Selena Gomez</a>. &nbsp;A <a href=#>source</a>&nbsp;said&nbsp;&nbsp;"He would have liked it to have been something but now that time has passed he realizes a relationship with Selena will never happen." Lame!</p><p></p><h2 id=12-devin-lima---lfo><strong>12. Devin Lima - LFO</strong></h2><p>LFO, which stood for "Lyte Funky Ones" (lame) was a rather horrible boy band back in the late 90's. They did sell some records - at last count they were up around 5 million all time. Still though, Lima just didn't cut it. And you want to talk lame? He at one point was performing as "Live From Orlando" (LFO...get it?).</p><p></p><h2 id=11-jacob-underwood---o-town><strong>11. Jacob Underwood - O-Town</strong></h2><p>O-Town pretty much is the definition of lame. They were put together to capitalize on the boy band fad by MTV, for the show&nbsp;Making the Band.&nbsp;Their first album did go platinum, but after that it was all downhill. And in a band that was lame, Jacob was the lamest. No one was buying the look, or the act, he was trying to pull off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=10-mark-owen---take-that><strong>10. Mark Owen - Take That</strong></h2><p>Mark was a member of the English boy band Take That. The band sold over 45 million albums over the years and featured possibly the most ridiculously cool boy band member of all time, <a href=#>Robbie Williams</a>. As cool as Williams is though, Owen is as lame as they get. Mark has tried to make a go of it solo, but with little luck.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-kevin-jonas---jonas-brothers><strong>9. Kevin Jonas - Jonas Brothers</strong></h2><p>I know, I know, <a href=#>he's the oldest member</a> of the Jonas Brothers, and he was even&nbsp;listed by People magazine as one of the sexiest men alive, how could he be lame? &nbsp;Listen, I hate to be the one to tell you, but he isn't sexy, and yes, he is in fact lame. I hope I don't need to explain this any further.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-any-member-of-menudo><strong>8. Any Member of Menudo</strong></h2><p>Menudo was just creepy. It was the boy band that never ended. That was supposed to be sort of the whole point of boy bands, that they would, you know, grow up and stop being boys. Not Menudo. Producers formed the band in 1977 and it finally disbanded in 2009. How did a boy band last 32&nbsp;years? Well as soon as a member got even a little old, the producers would boot them out and find a new one to take his place. Again...just creepy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-delious-kennedy---all-4-one><strong>7. Delious Kennedy - All-4-One</strong></h2><p>This band was reasonably successful, and they could sing, but lame? Very. While it is hard to pick which one of these guys was actually the lamest we are going to go with Delious Kennedy, purely because he REALLY doesn't seem to get quite how lame he is. &nbsp;The name had nothing to do with our choice. &nbsp;Really.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-joey-fatone---n-sync><strong>6. Joey Fatone - N'Sync</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Joey </a>seems cool enough, he is still around, you see him on TV now and then, he hosts some shows on cable and things of that nature. He really just seems like your nice, chubby uncle that you see on holidays. Nothing wrong with that. Well, except for the fact that even when he was in N'Sync, he seemed like your nice, chubby uncle that you would see on holidays.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-isaac-hanson---hanson><strong>5. Isaac Hanson - Hanson</strong></h2><p>We all remember when Hanson's big hit "MMMBop" came out. There was this really handsome lead singer, this really cute talented little drummer, and then... Well, then there was <a href=#>Isaac</a>. "MMMBop" came out almost 20 years ago, and all this time Hanson is still the "two cool brothers and then Isaac, that other guy" boy band.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-danny-wood---new-kids-on-the-block><strong>4. Danny Wood - New Kids on the Block</strong></h2><p>New Kids on the Block were huge. They sold 80 million copies worldwide, and managed to be a cute boy band, and also still just a bunch of kids from Boston. While the other four members of the band had it going on, <a href=#>Wood </a>never did. There was always some guy dancing around on stage that just didn't look like he was supposed to be there, and that guy was Danny Wood.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-a-j-mclean---backstreet-boys><strong>3. A.J. McLean - Backstreet Boys</strong></h2><p>Yes, the Backstreet Boys were so lame they get two on this list. <a href=#>A.J</a> just didn't belong. He also has had numerous struggles with drugs and addiction over his life, which he appears to have conquered at this point. That isn't lame, but the rest of his work with Backstreet Boys was rather cringeworthy.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-justin-jeffre---98-degrees><strong>2. Justin Jeffre - 98 Degrees</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Justin </a>was a member of 98 degrees. Unlike most boy bands, they formed on their own, and were not put together by a producer. They have sold over 10 million records over the years and of course, Nick Lachey was in the band. Justin never fit in. When he was up on the stage he looked like a middle-aged guy that was trying to become the Mayor of Cincinnati, not a guy in a boy band. That all makes sense because today Jeffre is a middle aged guy who tried to run for Mayor of Cincinnati. He lost. Go figure.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-chris-kirkpatrick---n-sync><strong>1. Chris Kirkpatrick - N'Sync</strong></h2><p>If you you were paying attention, and I know you were, you probably noticed that no <a href=#>Kirkpatrick</a> up to this point meant he was going to be number one. I mean, he seems like a nice guy, but seriously? Some of his attempts to be street were just simply embarrassing. And Chris, the white boy cornrows were bad enough, but when you put blonde highlights in there? The worst. Which is why Chris Kirkpatrick is our number one lamest boy band member ever.</p><p><strong>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>hollywoodlife.com</a>, <a href=#>ew.com</a>, <a href=#>people.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmptXaSzbsDHnmSlmZ2awLV5waiwZpqRo7FuucSmmZ6qo2Kyt7HRaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./good-morning-america-cohost-lara-spencer-marries-rick-mcvey.html><span>←</span><span>'Good Morning America' Cohost Lara Spencer Marries Rick McVey</span></a>
