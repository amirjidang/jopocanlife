Not only did cancel culture show her no mercy for her choice of comedy, but many of her fellow SNL cast members became frustrated with her seemingly overbearing nature, anti-gay rhetoric, and Christian faith.</p><p>After getting her big break on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, she was offered an opportunity to audition for the cast of Saturday Night Live in 1985. She then became a regular cast member on the show from 1986 to 1992.</p><p>During her tenure, she worked with other super-successful comedians like David Spade, Dana Carvey, Mike Myers, Adam Sandler, Julia Sweeney, and Nora Dunn. But following her homophobic and anti-Islamic rants, is she still friends with any of her former cast members?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-snl-cast-members-enjoy-working-with-victoria-jackson>Did SNL Cast Members Enjoy Working With Victoria Jackson?</h2><p>It's inevitable to find some level of conflict in the entertainment business, even among comedians like Victoria Jackson. Dislike and even <a href=#>hatred among SNL cast members was common</a>, but disdain was directed at Jackson because of her Christian faith and other matters outside of her control.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jackson would often bring up her faith</a> as often as possible, possibly in an attempt to inspire her co-workers to embrace her faith, resulting in their willing conversion. But all relentless attempts and unwelcome comments did was turn repel her co-workers, essentially alienating her from them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-design-39.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One particular action from Victoria Jackson that rubbed the SNL cast members the wrong way was when she left audiocassette copies of the bible in the mailboxes of each of the comedians as a Christmas gift one year. Suffice it to say, none of the cast members were happy about their gifts, and angrily sent them back to her.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar50339487.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Adam Sandler Has Regrets Looking Back At His Days On SNL</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Adam Sandler admitted to making several mistakes during his days on Saturday Night Live.</span><h3 id=victoria-jackson-39-s-best-snl-skits>Victoria Jackson's Best SNL Skits:</h3><ul><li><strong>'I Am Not A Bimbo' with Dennis Miller</strong></li><li><strong>'Victoria Jackson's Depression Dance' with Dennis Miller</strong></li><li><strong>'The Boyfriend Song' featuring Willie Nelson</strong></li><li><strong>'Victoria Jackson Reads A Christmas Poem' with Dennis Miller</strong></li></ul><p>Former SNL cast member Jan Hooks also took shots at Victoria Jackson's high-pitched voice, which, truthfully, made her sound like a "ditzy blonde." This was part of the reason her impersonations got her on the show to begin with.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/is-victoria-jackson-friends-with-any-former-snl-cast-members-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jackson attributes her speaking voice to a rare throat condition called congenial palatal deficiency. Nevertheless, Jan Hooks said this about her former cast member, "I just have a particular repulsion to grown women who talk like little girls. It's like: 'You're a grown woman! Use your lower register!'"</p><h2 id=is-victoria-jackson-still-friends-with-nora-dunn>Is Victoria Jackson Still Friends With Nora Dunn?</h2><p>Long before her "political awakening" in 2007, where she called out presidential candidate Barack Obama for being a radical Islam infiltrator and communist, Victoria Jackson was already disliked by many of the SNL cast.</p><p>Although Dunn was at odds with other rising comedians like Jon Lovitz and <a href=#>Andrew Dice Clay, whose sickness hasn't stopped his career</a>, she was extremely mad at Jackson.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/This-SNL-Star-Described-Chevy-Chase-And-Bill-Murrays-Fight-As-Sad_-Painful-And-Awful.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Which SNL Star Got In The Middle Of Bill Murray And Chevy Chase's Scrap?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Getting Bill Murray and Chevy Chase separated on SNL backstage was no easy task.</span><p>Nora Dunn left SNL in 1990, but had nothing good to say about her experiences with Victoria Jackson. Not only did she report that Jackson called her a "b****," but she had no interest in what Jackson had to say, and no desire to reconcile.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When Salon interviewed Dunn about the controversy</a>, she had this to say:</p><p>"I am not interested in what Victoria has to say. She has said that Obama is a Muslim who has imposed Sharia Law on us - crazy stuff like that... And I couldn't work with her because we weren't on the same page - ever.

Miller also auditioned to be a cast member on SNL in Los Angeles in 1985, where he was offered to be the newscast, and spent much of his time behind the Weekend Update desk.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-design-40.png><p>Although Dennis Miller went on to have a more commercially successful career as a radio and talk show host, he and Victoria Jackson seem to be treated the same by their former cast members.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When SNL's 40th Anniversary came in February 2015,</a> all other comedians were in attendance, except for Victoria Jackson and Dennis Miller. This led many to believe that they were intentionally uninvited because of their conservative beliefs.</p><h2 id=was-victoria-jackson-blacklisted-from-hollywood-for-her-beliefs>Was Victoria Jackson Blacklisted From Hollywood For Her Beliefs?</h2><p>Way before Victoria Jackson's "political epiphany" in 2007, she was already excessive with her religious convictions. Jackson recalled an encounter she had with Al Franken who addressed her for the "ditzy bact" she was putting on even when she wasn't on set.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And this was her response, "I told him that maybe I am overcompensating because everybody here is going to hell and I'm supposed to tell them about Jesus." This obviously didn't sit well with Franken, who never again spoke to Jackson backstage.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Saturday-Night-Live-Will-Ferrell-Hosting-Excited.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>This Was The Most Hilarious Time An SNL Cast Member Broke Character</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>One of the funniest moments on SNL happened when an actor who always managed to keep a straight face finally caved.​​​​​​​</span><h3 id=victoria-jackson-39-s-books>Victoria Jackson's Books:</h3><ul><li><strong>Is My Bow Too Big?

But after blasting gay marriage, Muslims, and Occupy Wall Street on conservative radio shows, she has good reason to believe that Hollywood would no longer consider her for a role - even a minor one - in 2024.</p><h2 id=who-is-victoria-jackson>Who Is Victoria Jackson?</h2><p>Born in Miami, Florida on August 2, 1959, Victoria Jackson was taught gymnastics by her father from the age of five until she was eighteen before receiving a gymnastics scholarship to attend Furman University in South Carolina.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/is-victoria-jackson-friends-with-any-former-snl-cast-members-2.jpg><p>Prior to that, she graduated from Florida Bible College in Hollywood, Florida.
