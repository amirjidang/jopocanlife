According to Forbes, Diddy’s net worth has jumped from a massive $740 million in 2019 to $885 million in 2020 - putting him on track to becoming the second rapper billionaire. Jay-Z is the first, and like Jay-Z, Diddy earns cash from much more than a few hit hip-hop tracks from the early 2000s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It isn’t actually Diddy’s music that makes him the most money these days. While he’s currently signed to Epic Records, the last time he released an album of his own was in 2006. He’s raking in the cash through literally dozens of other business ventures, some of which have been running for over 20 years. According to him, his lifelong commitment to giving customers his best is the reason for his success.</p><p>“I started my business career at age 12, delivering newspapers,” Diddy explained in Forbes’ ‘Greatest Business Minds’ issue. “Since then, I’ve always understood that if I give the customers my best and service them differently, whether music, clothing or vodka, I’ll get a return on my hard work.”</p><p>Read on to find out just which products and services make Diddy his millions today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aquahydrate-bottled-water><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>AQUAhydrate Bottled Water</span></h2><p>For this bottled water company, Diddy partnered with A-list actor, Mark Wahlberg, and marketed the product as a sort of fitness drink. It’s advertised as having twice the amount of electrolytes of other bottled waters and an “elevated alkaline pH level”.</p><p>A marketing claim on the packaging indicates that the bottled water can&nbsp; “restore hydration levels during performance without any sugar or calories.” Water that’s hydrating? Revolutionary.</p><h2 id=some-best-selling-fragrances><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Some Best-Selling Fragrances</span></h2><p>If you want to smell like you also have millions upon millions of dollars in the bank, try Diddy's own personal fragrance brands. His main fragrance is a men’s cologne called ‘Unforgivable’, which was a number-one bestseller in the United States upon its release in 2006.</p><p>Since then, he’s put out ‘Unforgivable Woman,’ ‘Unforgivable Night,’ ‘I Am King,’ and ‘3AM’. These scents are stocked at fragrance stores everywhere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=royalties-from-the-notorious-b-i-g><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Royalties From The Notorious B.I.G.</span></h2><p>Diddy makes a substantial amount of his fortune from his late business partner and friend, Biggie. Diddy's label produced two posthumous Biggie albums, and each one put some profits into Diddy’s pockets. Diddy’s faced major criticism for these moves.</p><p>"Biggie's name should never have become Diddy's Black Card,” Tweeted 50 Cent in 2011. “When was the last time Diddy really was biggin up his brother, not biggin up his bank?”</p><h2 id=sean-john-clothing-line><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Sean John Clothing Line</span></h2><p>In 1998, Diddy launched Sean John, his own fashion line and clothing company. It’s been turning a profit ever since, with a high point in 2004, when it earned Diddy the prestigious Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) award for Menswear Designer of the Year.</p><p>Sean John’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">latest release</a> is a 2020 T-shirt collection with bold slogans like “Own The Future” and “Never Surrender.”</p><h2 id=combs-wine-and-spirits><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Combs Wine And Spirits</span></h2><p>Since 2013, Diddy has owned Combs Wine and Spirits, a liquor company that manages his branded alcoholic products. As Beverage Media Group reports, Diddy launched it so that he could take full advantage of his “access to influencers” and we totally get it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Celebrities like to pop bottles, so why not be the person who makes those bottles? Diddy’s partied enough to know how much money’s in the liquor game.</p><h2 id=ciroc-vodka><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Ciroc Vodka</span></h2><p>Ciroc wasn’t always Diddy’s, but since he bought a 50 percent stake in the company, The Financial Times reports that Cîroc has grown from selling 50,000 cases per year to 2 million cases per year!</p><p>Diddy’s rap industry connections have helped. The word ‘Ciroc’ is often dropped in tracks by artists like Meek Mills and Young Jeezy. One example: RiFF RAFF rapping “I just drank a gallon of Ciroc (roc, roc, roc)…”</p><h2 id=dele-n-tequila><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>DeLeón Tequila</span></h2><p>Yet another alcohol brand part-owned by Mr. Combs is DeLeón. It’s a so-called “luxury tequila brand”...with the prices to prove it. The brand has six different products, ranging from the relatively affordable DeLeón Diamante ($150 per bottle) to the ultra-luxe DeLeón Leóna ($850 per bottle). All tequilas in the collection are made from Blue Weber agave from the highlands of Jalisco.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Diddy’s 50th Birthday Bash Was An Epic, Celeb-Studded Gala!</a></span></p><h2 id=revolt-tv-network><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>REVOLT TV Network</span></h2><p>By creating his own cable network, Diddy has access to more than 50 million viewers (according to his own company’s stats at CombsEnterprises.com). His station, called REVOLT TV, has Diddy-curated music videos, music news. recording artist interviews, exclusive performances, and even its own original programming.</p><p>You can watch it all from the US, the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, and Trinidad - it’s THAT international.</p><h2 id=revolt-film-enterprise><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>REVOLT Film Enterprise</span></h2><p>Diddy’s film production company is no joke. It’s got more than ten feature films under its belt, including one (Lawless) that was nominated for a Palme D’Or at Cannes and won big at the Hollywood Film Awards.</p><p>If that’s not impressive enough, another REVOLT film (Undefeated) actually won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2012. That’s right - Diddy has an Oscar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=capital-preparatory-school><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Capital Preparatory School</span></h2><p>In 2016, Diddy opened a charter school in Harlem, NYC. "I want Harlem to have the best schools," he explained in the school’s opening ceremonies. "The best of everything. Instead of me complaining about education, I want to do something about it. So that's why I'm starting this school.”</p><p>He doesn’t make much money from it but launching the school was one of his many business ventures.</p><h2 id=bad-boy-entertainment><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Bad Boy Entertainment</span></h2><p>Way back in 1993, Diddy founded Bad Boy Records, a label imprint under Sony Music Media. Over the years, Bad Boy has backed the top artists in rap and R&B, from Faith Evans and Boyz N Da Hood to Mase and Machine Gun Kelly.</p><p>Fun fact: Diddy launched this label after working as an intern at Uptown Records, where he actually helped to develop Mary J. Blige’s first album.</p><h2 id=bad-boy-touring><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Bad Boy Touring</span></h2><p>The Bad Boy label’s tour activity is managed by Bad Boy Touring, which is obviously also owned by Diddy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The company's biggest event was the Bad Boy Family Reunion Tour in 2016. It featured performances by Bad Boy artists, such as Diddy himself and Lil Kim, plus guest artists, including Kanye West, ASAP Rocky, Rick Ross, Jay-Z, Gucci Mane, Kodak Black, and more. That tour alone earned Diddy $17.5 million, according to Rolling Stone.</p><h2 id=the-combs-foundation><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Combs Foundation</span></h2><p>If you haven’t noticed yet, we’ll tell you - Diddy is into giving back to the communities that raised him. He acknowledges that the urban East Coast community that fostered his talents is to thank for launching his career, and wants others to have similar opportunities.</p><p>The Combs Foundation has given funds to budding entrepreneurs and hard-working students, through initiatives like the Urban Entrepreneurs Foundation and donations to his alma mater, Howard University.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> 18 Pics That Change The Way We See Sean “Diddy” Combs</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=janice-combs-music-publishing><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Janice Combs Music Publishing</span></h2><p>Diddy owns Janice Combs Music Publishing, a company managing more than 1500 copyrights for artists and music writers. When films want to use music that Janice Combs Music Publishing owns the rights to. like some of DJ Khaled’s tracks, they pay the company for access to that music.</p><p>This is a pretty genius move on Diddy’s part since his own media networks make up a lot of Janice Combs Music Publishing’s client base.</p><h2 id=enyce><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>ENYCE</span></h2><p>Yet another clothing brand that generates profits which boost Diddy’s bank balance is ENYCE, a company he started in 1996. It’s marketed as a “hip-hop/streetwear line” with products ranging from nostalgia-inducing sneakers to reprints of slogan tees that artists like Jay-Z wore in the 90s.</p><p>Hit ENYCE up for styles that make you look like you featured on a Bad Boy Records-produced album from 1999.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebrity Fashion Brands That Got Called Out</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zac-posen-s-fashion-empire><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Zac Posen's Fashion Empire</span></h2><p>Zac Posen’s clothing brand is way different from every other one of Diddy’s fashion ventures. It’s super preppy and buttoned-up when compared to Sean John and ENYCE, but Diddy is an equal partner in the Zac Posen fashion empire. This means 50 percent of all Zac Posen clothing profits since 2004 have gone right into Diddy’s own bank account, according to a deal reported by the fashion news website, WWD.</p><h2 id=the-blue-flame-agency><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Blue Flame Agency</span></h2><p>Diddy’s final million-dollar enterprise (for now) is this full-service marketing and advertising agency based in NYC. According to Adweek, his Blue Flame Agency has managed large-scale marketing campaigns for Anheuser-Busch’s World Select, Calvin Klein’s Crave perfume, Bacardi USA, Hewlett-Packard, and Sony Pictures.</p><p>With a client base like that, can anyone be surprised that Diddy’s pushing billionaire status?</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Facts About Sean “Diddy” Combs’ Impressive Car Collection</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Sources</strong>: Forbes.com, BlackEnterprise.com, IMDB.com, TheGuardian.com, BeverageMedia.com, Lyrics.com, RollingStone.com, WWD.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhocGWjqr%2BxvsisoKefXayuur%2BMrJyapl2ZtqWw2GaaqKWSqHqurcinq5qhnqh6qbXSZm9xbV2itq24yKilZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./13-bro-code-rules-every-guy-has-in-his-dna.html><span>←</span><span>13 Bro Code Rules Every Guy Has In His DNA</span></a>
