You don’t strike fear in my heart. There is no, ‘Oh my God, he’s going to get me!’ I did content about the biggest killers in the world in Chicago. I’ve talked about the worst people you could imagine … I won’t be sitting here scared of an older ni**a who claims he’s a ‘thug.'”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">DJ Akademiks decided to get more direct in his subsequent statements and called out Punch by name. “Mr. Punch from TDE, you didn’t have to delete your tweet,” he said. “I’m not scared of you. I don’t know nobody that’s scared of you and I don’t know nobody that would think you be doing nothing. So please, pipe down, and rather than delete the tweet, don’t send the tweet. Because if you look at my tweet history, I leave them up for all to see.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The former <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Everyday Struggle</a> host called the TDE President out for claiming he is not playing internet games while making comments on the internet. “This is why we’re laughing: you’re tweeting [about how] you’re not playing internet games while you’re tweeting it!” he exclaimed. “This is why I said y’all are not Suge Knight. Suge Knight wouldn’t give a nice proper warning and then delete the tweet. I don’t think he’d tweet at all. I just want to let you know, if [the tweet] was even remotely aimed at me, it was received, laughed at and sent back. We’re not scared of none of you ni**as.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Akademiks ended his rant with a patronizing tone, urging Punch to focus on his label and put some music out because neither of them wants to die or go to jail over this situation. Check out the full rant below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">It is unclear why DJ Akademiks targeted SZA, but his comments drew the ire of many fans. “You love to eat, you are an eater. It’s cool, I love to eat too,” he said last week. “But y’all be fat just like me, looking like a linebacker, your neck thick as a 32-pack of franks, and now y’all acting like y’all bad. You fat as f**k, let’s keep it a bean.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“You know you’ve been under the knife mad times,” he continued in the tirade. “We don’t care how much you show that little botched&nbsp;BBL, you need to get back to the doctor one more time, and I’ma stand on it!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">At one point, he also referred to the “Snooze” singer as a “fat mini Lizzo.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a4orDEpqCkq12hrrazx6xkrZyVYr22usKhZJ2dlpq7pbXNoGSsspFis6LAjKyfmqWZo7RufZFsa3BwYWh9ens%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./candice-swanepoel-flashes-her-butt-in-sunburn-photo-w158926.html><span>←</span><span>Candice Swanepoel Flashes Her Butt in Sunburn Photo</span></a>
