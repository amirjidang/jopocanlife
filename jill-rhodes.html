He used to leave her interesting and regular voicemail messages during the intermediate months between first speaking with Hannity on the phone and to see him in person. Intrigued, she visited the mayoral debate in Huntsville that he arranged in 1992.</p><p>In April 2017, Hannity was accused of improper conduct by conservative blogger Debbie Schlussel in the wake of the sexual harassment controversy involving Fox News that saw the exit of former chief Roger Ailes and star mainstream conservative analyst Bill O’Reilly from the simple cable news channel.</p><p>Hannity denied the accusations vehemently, finding them defamatory and threatening to take legal action. There were rumors of a potential split between him and Rhodes afterward, but they were baseless.</p><p>It also reported that the extreme speculation had led investigators to look into the whole Hannity family’s finances, putting out “Jill’s multi-million dollar secret” in the public. Apparently, the explanation was that she invented an “alternative to plastic surgery” called Nouveau Restor Revitalizing Moisturizer. Hannity later stated that such claims were “all lies” in an e-mailed statement to the ‘Daily Beast’.</p><p>Married to Sean Hannity, the couple has two children a son and a daughter.</p><table width=604><tbody readability=3><tr><td>Boyfriends</td><td width=481>Sean Hannity</td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td width=481>Married</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Husband</td><td width=481 readability=5>Sean Hannity<p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibio.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Jill-Rhodes-with-her-kids.jpg></p></td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Children</td><td width=481 readability=7><strong>Son –</strong> Sean Patrick Hannity (born November 3, 1998)<p><strong>Daughter –</strong> Merri Kelly Hannity (born in 2002)</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibio.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/jill-rhodes-pinterest-300x282.jpg></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Here we provide you the list of Jill Rhodes’s favorite things.</p><table width=576><tbody><tr><td>Favorite Actors</td><td width=350>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Favorite Actress</td><td width=350>Not Known</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li>The spouse of Jill Rhodes obtained an honorary degree at Liberty University.</li></ul><ul><li>As the Forbes survey of 2018, because of his closeness to Trump, Hannity became the most-watched talk show host on television and radio.</li></ul><ul><li>He was <a class=wpil_keyword_link title="Donald Trump" href=#>Donald Trump</a>’s former supporter during the 2016 Presidential Election in the USA.</li></ul><ul><li>For him, Sean acted as a mouthpiece and criticized a number of things.
