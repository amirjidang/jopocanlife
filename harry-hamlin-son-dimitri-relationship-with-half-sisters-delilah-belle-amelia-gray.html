He doesn't have any social media accounts and doesn't give interviews. It isn't clear how often Dimitri sees his father or his half-siblings, but there are photos of them at events from time to time, and they appear to get along.</p><p>While Ursula Andress had Dimitri in Rome, he lives in Los Angeles. According to The Los Angeles Times, Ursula had a house in Beverly Hills that she put on the market in 2017 and made $2.28 million. Since Dimitri lives in the same place as his half-siblings, that must make it super easy for them to see each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-harry-hamlin-39-s-son-dimitri-hamlin>Who Is Harry Hamlin's Son Dimitri Hamlin?</h2><p>According to People, Ursula Andress gave birth to Dimitri Hamlin in 1980 and she and Harry Hamlin dated until 1983.

She has starred in many movies like What's New Pussycat? and Double Murder, although her Bond role is absolutely the one that people think about when they hear her name.</p><p>Hollywood Life reported that Dimitri has been an actor, including starring on a show that aired in Italy called Caterina e le sue figlie (translated to My Daughters). He has also been a DJ, a model, and been in music videos.</p><p>According to his IMDb page, Dimtiri also starred in a short film called Say Cheese! in 2022.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What Lisa Rinna And Harry Hamlin's Lives Were Like Before They Met Each Other</a></span></p><p>Similar to his actor parents, Dimitri Hamlin has definitely worked in artistic fields throughout his life.

It's About Time" and "Is That All There Is? Rugged Individualism." It seems that this column allowed him to think about concepts that he studied in philosophy classes.</p><h2 id=what-has-lisa-rinna-said-about-harry-hamlin-39-s-son-dimitri-hamlin>What Has Lisa Rinna Said About Harry Hamlin's Son Dimitri Hamlin?</h2><p>Lisa Rinna spoke about Dimitri Hamlin in an episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. According to People, she said, "He said she called him and said, 'Harry, come to my room.' And so he did, at 28 years old, he went in and she got pregnant that night. And that was that, at 44. First time."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Lisa Rinna Really Thinks About Harry Hamlin's Affair Rumors</a></span></p><p>Lisa also said that when Harry and Ursula were dating, they stayed at the home that she has shared with Harry for years.

Lisa said, "The other day, the girls were playing hair salon, and Harry was the client. He had rubber bands in his hair – can you just picture that? He will sit there for hours. He is so patient. I learn from him."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar49818407.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lisa also spoke about making sure to be there for her daughters despite her busy and bustling acting career.</p><p>She said, "I am in the moment. When I am with the children, I am WITH them. They know that and they feel that. When you’re with the kids, you should really pay attention — and not think about the grocery list or anything else. Or, when I am working, I am really doing that."</p><p>Considering how much time Lisa Rinna and Harry Hamlin spend with Amelia Gray and Delilah Belle, and the warm family life they have prioritized, it seems easy to assume that they are just as close with Dimitri Hamlin. When Lisa spoke about Dimitri on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, she sounded friendly and respectful of the fact that her husband had a child with someone else, and it sounds like she accepted it right away.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifmqqirnqprcyloKdlo6S7brDIpqCtqpliv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxedaiq6FlmJa5p3nSoqqtnaKoeqWxy6KjmqBdl7KtuMRmmKadnJ6ubrPRmrBo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./demi-lovato-shows-off-her-cleavage-in-plunging-swimsuit-pics-w477861.html><span>←</span><span>Demi Lovato Shows Off Her Cleavage in Plunging Swimsuit: Pics</span></a>
