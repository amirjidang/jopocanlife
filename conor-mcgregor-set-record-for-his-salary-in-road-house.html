Let's see what happens."</p><p>McGregor would also discuss backing out of a Vikings offer, despite the show's popularity.</p><p>"I was supposed to be in the Vikings and I pulled out last minute. They were very upset and I apologized over that. It's been the fight business for me and I can dominate show business. I have enough experience with the camera on my face.
