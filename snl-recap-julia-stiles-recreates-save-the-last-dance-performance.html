She removed her festive Mrs. Claus dress to reveal a black leotard and sweatpants, which was similar to the outfit that Stiles, now 42, wore during the film’s audition scene.</p><p class=p1>“Hit it!” Fineman exclaimed before busting out a near-flawless replica of Stiles’ moves. “[This is] street-ballet. Basically, Julia Stiles’ character is an uptight ballerina, who auditions to get into Juilliard but doesn’t get in. Then on the same day, her mom dies in a car crash.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/snl-recap-julia-stiles-recreates-save-the-last-dance-performance-002.jpg><p class=p1>Jost, 41, however, was confused about how the “street” element came into the ballet routine, but Che, 40, clarified the movie’s plot for him.</p><p class=p1>“Colin, come on,” Che quipped. “Sara moves to the south side of Chicago and goes to a more urban high school, where she learns hip-hop, duh.”</p><p class=p1>Fineman also detailed the story line too, explaining to Jost that Stiles’ character eventually got another chance to audition for the prestigious arts college — and her crush Derek (played by <strong>Sean Patrick Thomas</strong>) skipped a “drive-by shooting” to show his support. The camera then panned to <i>SNL </i>cast member <strong>Devon Walker</strong>, dressed like Derek, pumping his fists and nodding his head.</p><p class=p1>By the end, Jost just wanted to know if Sara’s routine was good enough to secure her admittance to Juilliard. Stiles herself then jumped in to answer the inquiry.</p><p class=p1>“Yes,” Stiles shouted, sporting a matching leotard and sweatpants. “Sara did get into Juilliard.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/snl-recap-julia-stiles-recreates-save-the-last-dance-performance-02.jpg><p class=p1>After Jost wondered “how,” <a href=#>Stiles pointed out</a> that he hadn’t seen the end of the crowd-pleasing routine yet. Stiles and Fineman, in unison, performed the chair portion of the <i>Save the Last Dance</i> number.</p><p class=p1>“So, Colin, what did you think?” Fineman asked before Jost noted his approval. He added, quoting the film, “Well, I can’t say this on the record yet, but welcome to Juilliard!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Stiles and Fineman, who were waiting for the results with bated breath, then shared their excitement over the rave review. “Yay,” they replied.</p><p class=p1><i>Saturday Night Live</i> airs on NBC Saturdays at 11:30 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqnpF2nsqStz2ahrqSZlnq0wMilnKxlopqws7HArZysZaOWw6Z506GcZqSRqMFusMCnmp5loJq%2Fp7vRppinm5Vk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marcella-samora.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Selena Quintanilla-Prez's Mother Marcella Samora?</span></a>
