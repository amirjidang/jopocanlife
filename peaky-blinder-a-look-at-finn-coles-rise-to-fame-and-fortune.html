These days, he's most notably recognized for his pivotal role on the smash hit British crime drama series, Peaky Blinders. The BBC has managed to protect the integrity of all the actors on the show by refusing to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reveal their salaries</a>, but multiple resources have leaked the details of Finn's fortune. Rumor has it that his role on Peaky Blinders, paired with his other acting roles in television and film have carried this young star to a $2 million net worth valuation. This is a pretty good start for a young man that stumbled into acting without any expectations.</p><h2 id=acting-wasn-t-originally-part-of-his-plan>Acting Wasn't Originally Part Of His Plan</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This whole acting stint is really working out for Finn Cole, and has turned him into a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">multi-millionaire well before the age of 30</a>. That's an interesting accomplishment, especially considering that Finn had no aspirations to ever become an actor in the first place.</p><p>As a young child, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Finn was one of 5 boys raised by his mother</a>, who was a housewife, and his father, who worked at the seaport. For several years, Cole expressed interest in repairing boats alongside his father. He never really dreamt of pursuing an acting career,&nbsp;but all that would change, and his entire life would soon shift...</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Peaky Blinders: The Way Cillian Murphy Quietly Earned His First $20 Million</a></span></p><h2 id=finn-s-brother-played-a-pivotal-role-in-his-acting-career>Finn's Brother Played A Pivotal Role In His Acting Career</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Joe Cole had an active acting career and was pursuing roles in various genres.&nbsp; While working on perfecting his role as Tommy in Offender, he saw an opportunity for his younger brother to act alongside him, and he managed to convince Finn Cole to join the cast.
