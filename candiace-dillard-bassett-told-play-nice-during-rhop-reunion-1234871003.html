According to the expectant mother, this was at the request of <a href=# id=auto-tag_bravo data-tag=bravo>Bravo</a> producers.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">While discussing her recently<a href=#> announced pregnancy,</a> Bassett shared with <a rel=nofollow href=#>ET </a>that she was told to be “less vitriolic” than she had during previous reunions.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I think for me, the the gift and the curse of being Candiace is, I rarely leave things unsaid,” the reality star, 37, revealed. “I historically cannot go on or move forward without saying exactly how I feel. I do think that I maybe took a sort of different approach at this reunion, at the request of the network, to try and be less vitriolic and more in a space and a spirit of moving forward, and you know, you saw some of that.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“There were things that I would’ve said had I not been given those directives,” she went on, “but at this juncture, it just feels moot. It feels like there isn’t anything else to say. I am so removed, mentally, from there, from that ship. I’m in my house on solid ground.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2123622785.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Bassett announced <a href=#>her departure</a> from the series weeks before cluing the world in to her pregnancy with an official statement: “As I embark on a new chapter after&nbsp;six remarkable years with&nbsp;The&nbsp;Real Housewives of Potomac, I am filled with gratitude for the enriching friendships, personal growth, and moments of introspection that have defined this journey. With a whirlwind of new opportunities and responsibilities on my plate, I have decided to take a break from&nbsp;RHOP.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">While discussing the future of the cast, the “Benefits” singer shared, “My hope is that they can unsink themselves.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It wasn’t fun to be a part of it, I know I can speak for all of us when I say that — I can speak for the whole cast,” she reflected. “My hope would just be that there can be a dynamic shift, that there can be growth and change and a lightening of things. I wish them well.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In addition to Bassett, cast mate Robyn Dixon also <a href=#>won’t be returning</a>, revealing she was fired on her Reasonably Shady podcast, co-hosted by Gizelle Bryant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2105329924.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It’s reality. The network did not invite me back. I was fired, for lack of better words,” Dixon shared with listeners. “I will not sugarcoat the situation and say, ‘Oh, I am walking away and this is a break’ or anything like this. This is a network decision.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5iur7DImpqeZZSeua2t0Z1km5mjqLK1wIytpqWcXaW5osWMp6CcnV2ZwrO1zaBkq6CfpXqzsdSnoKimXWZ%2FdICXcGhpaGNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brooklyn-nets-star-kevin-durant-launches-a-200-million-spac-firm.html><span>←</span><span>Brooklyn Nets' Star Kevin Durant Launches A $200 Million SPAC Firm</span></a>
