Barbara and Kenneth, according to Steven, raped him nine times when he was nine years old.</p><p>On Kenneth’s orders, Barbara tried to get another young child who was a Santa Rosa Boys’ Club member with Stayner into Parnell’s automobile in 1975.

Steven was abused the first night in Parnell’s cabin. On December 17, 1972, Kenneth began rapping Steven thirteen days later.</p><p>After Steven told Kenneth several times that he wanted to go home during the first week, Kenneth informed him that he had been awarded legal custody of the youngster because his parents couldn’t afford so many children and no longer wanted him.</p><p>When enrolling Steven in several schools over the following several years, Kenneth began calling him Dennis Gregory Parnell while keeping his actual middle name and birth date.</p><p>Kenneth pretended to be Stayner’s father, and the two traveled throughout California a lot, residing in places like Santa Rosa and Comptche.</p><p>Kenneth began looking for a younger child to abduct as Steven approached adolescence. Kenneth had previously used Steven to attempt to abduct children, but all of the efforts had failed.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=details-on-steven-stayner-parents-and-siblings></span>Details On Steven Stayner Parents and Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Steven Stayner was born in Merced, California, to Delbert and Kay Stayner.
