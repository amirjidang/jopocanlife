<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Jane Fonda Slams Seth MacFarlane's &amp;quot;We Saw Your Boobs&amp;quot; Oscars Song</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Lena Dunham</strong> isn't the only celebrity who was offended by <strong>Seth MacFarlane</strong>'s musical number during the 85th Annual Academy Awards, in which the first-time host saluted actresses who went topless on film. <strong>Jane</strong> <strong>Fonda</strong>, who presented the Best Director award with <strong>Michael Douglas</strong>, slammed the Family Guy creator in a Feb. 27 blog post on her <a href=#>official website</a>.</p><p>During MacFarlane's original song, which he performed with the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles, the 39-year-old comic referenced everyone from <a href=#><strong>Halle Berry</strong></a> to <a href=#><strong>Kate</strong> <strong>Winslet</strong></a>. What the song failed to mention, however, was that several of the actress' topless moments occurred during rape scenes.</p><p>Though the Oscar winner (and former Academy Awards host!) praised <a href=#><strong>Charlize Theron</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Channing</strong> <strong>Tatum</strong></a>'s dance number and <a href=#><strong>Catherine Zeta-Jones</strong></a>' "All That Jazz" performance, the 75-year-old feminist was less than impressed with MacFarlane.</p><p>"What I really didn't like was the song and dance number about seeing actresses boobs. I agree with someone who said, 'If they want to stoop to that, why not list all the penises we've seen?' Better yet, remember that this is a telecast seen around the world watched by families with their children and to many this is neither appropriate or funny," Fonda wrote. "I also didn’t like the remark made about [<strong>Quvenzhane Wallis</strong> and <a href=#><strong>George Clooney</strong></a>], or the stuff out of Ted's mouth and all the comments about what women do to get thin for their dresses. Way too much stuff about women and bodies, as though that's what defines us."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In a <a href=#>series of tweets</a> on Feb. 26, Girls' creator and star Dunham defended Best Actress in a Supporting Role winner <a href=#><strong>Anne Hathaway</strong></a> and similarly criticized MacFarlane for his sexist song. "Ladies: Anne Hathaway is a feminist and she has amazing teeth. Let's save our bad attitudes for the ones who aren't advancing the cause," the 26-year-old Golden Globe winner wrote. "Hey ragers. 'The ones who aren't advancing the cause' I mentioned aren't always, or mostly, women. Case in point: I saw your boobs."</p><p>At least one person found the humor in MacFarlane's opening skit: Best Actress in a Leading Role winner <a href=#><strong>Jennifer</strong> <strong>Lawrence</strong></a>, 22. "I loved the boob song," the Silver Linings Playbook star told reporters after her big win. "I thought [Seth MacFarlane] was great!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmZ6aeqe7zZ2YZquclrq0edKeq6FlnZawp63RpZinnaNixKZ50pquZrGfqr9urs6omaxln6iwor7SZqqoppdif3F9kmtva2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jamie-lee-curtis.html><span>←</span><span>Jamie Lee Curtis News - Us Weekly</span></a>
