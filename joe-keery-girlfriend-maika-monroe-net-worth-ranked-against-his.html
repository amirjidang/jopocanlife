He's an actor in the exciting TV show 'Stranger Things' which crosses paranormal horror with teenage drama. Joe is also a musician and has been a member of the rock band Post Animal. On top of that, he also seems to have a tremendous love life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No, it's not with co-star Charlie Heaton. Joe Keery and Charlie Heaton might have the <a href=#>world's biggest bromance</a>, but Joe's real relationship seems to be with fellow actress Maika Monroe. Although, their current relationship status remains a mystery.</p><p>Not many people know Maika Monroe by name but would recognize her if they saw her. That's because she was the main star in the 2015 hit horror film 'It Follows'. The movie was similar to 'Stranger Things', in that it's a horror story involving teenagers. Maika was also in 2016's 'Independence Day: Resurgence'. It's safe to assume that since these two have been in many high-profile projects they've made a lot of money. How do they compare to each other? Joe might be the bigger name, but does he make more money than Maika? Here's what you need to know.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=everything-to-know-about-joe-keery-and-maika-monroe-39-s-relationship>Everything To Know About Joe Keery And Maika Monroe's Relationship</h2><p>Joe and Maika have a bit of a secretive relationship. However, their relationship isn't entirely private.</p><p>According to GQ, the couple met when they appeared in the film 'After Everything'. Since then, the only public facts about them are that they show up to premieres together. Maika showed up to the premiere of 'Stranger Things' Season 2 in 2017. They also attended Chloe Grace Moretz' birthday party in February 2018, their first appearance together off of the red carpet.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Joe Keery's Girlfriend Kept Their Relationship Status A Secret</a></span></p><p>'After Everything' then came out in late 2018 with generally positive reviews. Joe and Maika's authenticity together showed up on the screen, which is what was seen as positive about the movie. From then on, they slowly made their relationship a bit more public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/joe-keery-left-and-maika-monroe-right.jpg><p>Joe finally opened up about Maika in a 2021 interview. After spending most of the pandemic together, their relationship appeared to be rock solid. Considering a lot of people broke up or got divorced throughout quarantine, Joe and Maika seem to use the troubling period of time to strengthen their bond with each other. However, at the time of this writing, it's unclear if they have gone their separate ways or not.</p><h2 id=how-big-is-joe-keery-39-s-net-worth>How Big Is Joe Keery's Net Worth?</h2><p>It's assumed that, because Joe has appeared on one of the biggest TV shows in the world, he'd really be making the big bucks. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to LADBible</a>, Joe has a net worth of $4 million, so that guess would be pretty accurate. He currently makes $250,000 per episode. Considering he's more of a supporting cast member rather than a main character, that's a pretty good paycheck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Stranger Things' Joe Keery And His Girlfriend Are The Ultimate Fashion Couple</a></span></p><p>At one point in time, Joe had to <a href=#>interfere with the writers</a> from axing his character from the show. That's very interesting that the writers thought they should kill Steve off, considering he is an absolute fan favorite. Joe definitely used his status with the fans as one of his defenses.</p><p>Joe has been in other projects besides 'Stranger Things' and 'After Everything'. His portfolio includes 2021's 'Free Guy', 2017's 'Molly's Game' and 2020's 'Spree', the latter of which he played as the main character. He does really seem to keep himself busy in between seasons of 'Stranger Things'.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-big-is-maika-monroe-39-s-net-worth>How Big Is Maika Monroe's Net Worth?</h2><p>While Maika might not make as much as Joe, she certainly has made a sizable fortune. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Maika has a net worth of $1 million. If the rumors about their marriage are true, then they'll have a combined $5 million net worth when they tie the know. With the potential movies and shows these stars could appear in, their net worths could rocket up even more over the next few years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is 'Stranger Things' Star Joe Keery's Girlfriend, Maika Monroe?</a></span></p><p>Most of Maika's money comes from 'It Follows'. Despite it being low budget, the movie made waves back in 2015 due to its critical acclaim. The movie also spread via word of mouth. Perhaps her major role in the Independence Day sequel made more money than 'It Follows'.</p><p>More recently, Maika Monroe has starred in Greta, The Stranger, Brothers By Blood, and the horror film Watcher, in which she was the lead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Joe and Maika <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have been rumored, at times</a>, to be heading toward Splitsville. At the time of this writing, it simply is unclear if the two are still together due to their desire for privacy. But on Maika's Instagram page, it appears as though she spends more time with friends than anyone else. They have not been spotted publicly together for some time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqJ1doLKmvthmnqKqnJu%2FqrHNnWSmmZmgrm65zqepqJ1do7K1edaoqa2gXaeur7fEnWSan5Geu7TAjKGgrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rob-mcelhenney-kaitlin-olson-always-sunny-philadelphia-50-million-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>How Do Rob McElhenney And Kaitlin Olson Spend Their $50 Million Net Worth?</span></a>
