Not a surprise, his brother won't be appearing either, and it doesn't seem as though he has any acting gigs lined up in the near future.</p><p>Instead, the former actor seems to be committed towards his new business, which is a DJ agency helping artists get booked for gigs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He posted about his involvement to Instagram.
