Not to say the other two movies weren't good; they are what led to the third being so phenomenal. Of course, a great trilogy needs a great cast, or even something as well written as The Lord of the Rings would fall apart.

Cate Blanchett is a renowned actress known for many incredible performances, like her Oscar-winning role as Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator and her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth I in Elizabeth.</p><p>Her talent is undeniable and has earned her a spot as one of the top leading ladies in Hollywood as well as a substantial net worth of $95 million.

Billy Crystal is an icon in Hollywood, known for so much more, like his role in the classic film When Harry Met Sally.</p><p>With a net worth of $60 million, Billy Crystal has made a significant impact on both the comedy and film industries. He has an amazing ability to bring humor to any role, even a fantasy epic like The Lord of the Rings. His voice is unique enough that audiences know it without seeing him, bringing excitement to the film as he is such a well-known fan favorite.</p><h2 id=ian-mckellen-as-gandalf-the-grey-in-lord-of-the-rings-60-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Ian McKellen As Gandalf The Grey In Lord Of The Rings ($60 Million Net Worth)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ian-mckellen-had-a-complete-emotional-breakdown-in-front-of-the-green-screen-while-filming-the-hobbit.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sir Ian McKellen portrayed Gandalf, a wise wizard who guides and aids Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring on their treacherous journey to destroy the One Ring.

His performance brought a sense of authority and wisdom to the role, making Gandalf a beloved and memorable character in the hearts of fans all over the world.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>Why Sean Bean Spent 2 Hours Scaling A Mountain Each Morning While Filming Lord Of The Rings</a></span></p><p>McKellen is often mistaken for Dumbledore in the Harry Potter franchise.

McKellen certainly doesn't lack passion in LOTR.
