Similar <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to how Harry Potter's Deathly Hallows is the most popular of that franchise.</a> The endings bring dedicated fans to an emotional conclusion and tie up all the storylines. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It brought in $1.1 billion at the box office</a>, too. Not to say the other two movies weren't good; they are what led to the third being so phenomenal. Of course, a great trilogy needs a great cast, or even something as well written as The Lord of the Rings would fall apart.

Cate Blanchett is a renowned actress known for many incredible performances, like her Oscar-winning role as Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator and her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth I in Elizabeth.</p><p>Her talent is undeniable and has earned her a spot as one of the top leading ladies in Hollywood as well as a substantial net worth of $95 million.

Billy Crystal is an icon in Hollywood, known for so much more, like his role in the classic film When Harry Met Sally.</p><p>With a net worth of $60 million, Billy Crystal has made a significant impact on both the comedy and film industries. He has an amazing ability to bring humor to any role, even a fantasy epic like The Lord of the Rings. His voice is unique enough that audiences know it without seeing him, bringing excitement to the film as he is such a well-known fan favorite.</p><h2 id=ian-mckellen-as-gandalf-the-grey-in-lord-of-the-rings-60-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Ian McKellen As Gandalf The Grey In Lord Of The Rings ($60 Million Net Worth)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ian-mckellen-had-a-complete-emotional-breakdown-in-front-of-the-green-screen-while-filming-the-hobbit.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sir Ian McKellen portrayed Gandalf, a wise wizard who guides and aids Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring on their treacherous journey to destroy the One Ring.

His performance brought a sense of authority and wisdom to the role, making Gandalf a beloved and memorable character in the hearts of fans all over the world.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>Why Sean Bean Spent 2 Hours Scaling A Mountain Each Morning While Filming Lord Of The Rings</a></span></p><p>McKellen is often mistaken for Dumbledore in the Harry Potter franchise. While <a href=#>he was asked to take on the part after the death of Richard Harris in 2002, he turned it down.</a> Harris had once told him in not so many words that he lacked passion in his acting, and Ian McKellen could not take over his role knowing that. McKellen certainly doesn't lack passion in LOTR.
