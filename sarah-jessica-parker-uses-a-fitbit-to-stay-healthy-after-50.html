The former Sex and the City star’s enviable physique proves a healthy body is achievable after 50 — with the help of her pedometer!</p><p>Parker, 53, who has 8-year-old twin daughters Tabitha and Marion with husband <a href=#><strong>Matthew Broderick</strong></a> (the couple welcomed the girls via surrogate), as well as 15-year-old son James, told The Doctors in a 2016 interview that the secret to her lean frame is quite simple. “I walk. I live in the city. I walk a lot,” the Divorce actress shared. “Right now that’s all I have time for but I also live in a house with like four or five flights of stairs and I have a Fitbit.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/sarah-jessica-parker-fit-after-50-02.jpg><p>As for her daily step goal? “10,000 steps,” the actress stated. In addition to pounding the pavement for about five miles per day, Parker noted her other fitness activities are all about the great outdoors: “I think walking is great. And swimming. I love the summer. I love to kayak.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Along with counting her steps every day, Parker said she had to encompass a 360-approach to reach her fitness goals as she’s gotten older. “I have to think more about things like bone density and lifting weights,” she noted. To get in her strength training, Parker fits in regular sweat sessions with fitness guru Anna Kaiser, creator of AKT, a dance-based workout that focuses on strength and interval training.</p><p>And of course, a healthy diet is also key. When asked which foods she always keeps stocked in her fridge, she had a surprising answer: “At this point I’d say, oh how crazy is this, almond milk. I love it. I can’t figure out if it’s like an entire meal, or desert, or thin and refreshing or thick like a milkshake. It’s like the <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> that keeps on giving. I’m crazy for almond milk,” the New Yorker said. Other favorites? “I’m crazy for artichoke hearts. We always have them in the fridge. We always have hearts of palm. They’re so freaking good.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGasmaKWtW62xKyqopuRYr2ivsqeqWato5rAbq2Mn6CtmpmperW7jKyrmrFdnbKiuNOhsGaZlqmys3mUaWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./santa-fe-klan-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Santa Fe Klan Biography</span></a>
