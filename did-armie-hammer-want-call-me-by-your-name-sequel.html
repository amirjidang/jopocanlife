When die-hard fans of the original Academy Award-winning film found out that both <a href=#>Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer would return for a sequel</a>, they couldn't contain themselves. But horrendous revelations about Armie Hammer's personal life, <a href=#>which caused him to check into rehab</a>, absolutely <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">obliterated the chances of a sequel</a> to Luca Guadagnino's movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For a time, both actors appeared to be down to return to their roles in the gay, age-gap, love story. Then Timothee had some doubts and there were some reports that he had dropped out. Following this, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vulture sat down with Armie Hammer</a> (before his scandal) and asked him what he thought. During the 2019 interview, Armie revealed some comments that made fans question whether he actually wanted to return to Luca's world or not...</p><h2 id=did-actually-armie-hammer-want-a-sequel-to-make-a-call-me-by-your-name>Did Actually Armie Hammer Want A Sequel To Make A Call Me By Your Name?</h2><p>Even though Armie Hammer was being interviewed by Vulture for the movie Hotel Mumbai, the journalist felt obligated to ask him about the potential Call My By Your Name sequel. At that time, director Luca Guadagnino claimed he was ready to return to that world. The original film was written by James Ivory and was based on a book Andre Aciman who also wrote a sequel book called "Find Me." Presumably, the second film would have been a direct adaptation of the second movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Deadline, Luca explained that he was ready to do a second movie in 2019 despite filming another Timothee Chalamet movie alongside <a href=#>rising star and Lost in Space star Taylor Russell</a>. "The truth of the matter is, my heart is still there, but I’m working on this movie now, and I’m hopefully going to do Scarface soon, and I have many projects and so will focus on this side of the Atlantic and the movies I want to make."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Lil Nas X And Fans Celebrate One Million Dislikes For 'Montero (Call Me By Your Name)' Music Video</a></span></p><p>Given the director's excitement, it made sense that the press would ask the cast about it...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The truth is, there have been really loose conversations about it, but at the end of the day — I’m sort of coming around to the idea that the first one was so special for everyone who made it, and so many people who watched it felt like it really touched them, or spoke to them," Armie Hammer said to Vulture when they asked him about making a second one. "And it felt like a really perfect storm of so many things, that if we do make a second one, I think we’re setting ourselves up for disappointment. I don’t know that anything will match up to the first, you know?"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Present Proof That This Armie Hammer Accuser Lied About Some Allegations</a></span></p><p>Even though Armie had some reservations about returning to the world and disappointing fans with the follow-up, he did claim that he would join in if everyone else did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I haven’t had that conversation with [Timothee and Luca] explicitly. But I mean, look. If we end up with an incredible script, and Timmy’s in, and Luca’s in, I’d be an a***ole to say no. But at the same time, I’m like, That was such a special thing, why don’t we just leave that alone?' Armie explained. "I’m not sure that it was ever really definitely going to happen. People just seemed so excited about it that we were like, 'Oh, yeah, f*** it! We’ll do it, sure!"</p><p>Armie then admitted that he had spoken about the idea of doing a sequel but sometime before the rumors really picked up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-was-the-call-me-by-your-name-sequel-canceled>Why Was The Call Me By Your Name Sequel Canceled?</h2><p>According to numerous reports, Armie Hammer's allegations ended the possibility of the Call me By Your Name Sequel. While the first movie received enough backlash for the age difference and power imbalance between the two characters, there's just no way that Hollywood would cast Armie in a role like that anytime soon.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Armie Hammer Didn't Understand About 'Call Me By Your Name'</a></span></p><p>It seems as though Armie Hammer is straight-up canceled in Hollywood now. He did have a role in the recently released Death On The Nile, but it was filmed prior to the horrific details of his scandal were brought to light. As of now, Armie does not have any more projects lined up. At least as far as the public is concerned. It appears as though he is doing what he can to recover personally before he attempts a comeback in the business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of Armie's public controversy, Call Me By Your Name's other star is now an A-lister. Thanks to his role as Elio in the film, Timothee Chalamet has become a bona fide star and one of the busiest actors around. Booking him for any project, especially a sequel, seems exceptionally challenging.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here’s What Really Inspired Lil Nas X’s Song ‘Call Me By Your Name’</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdlr%2ButcRmn5qlnZq%2FbsPAp6tmm5GhuW65xGaZsmWppMKzec2apJ5lo5q%2BtrHLaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dababy-trump-supporter-needs-cousin-pardoned-1234680822.html><span>←</span><span>DaBaby Says He's A Trump Supporter, Needs His Cousin Pardoned</span></a>
