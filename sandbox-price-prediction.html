It is operated on the <a href=#>Ethereum</a> blockchain and Unity Software that works on a play-to-earn model.&nbsp;</p><p>This system is comparable to Axie Infinity <a href=#>metaverse</a>, where players use SAND as their utility token to build, own, and monetize their gaming activity.&nbsp;</p><p>In an update to the <a href=#>cryptocurrency</a> market trend, the Sandbox NFT gaming in a financing round led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund raised $93m earlier in November.&nbsp;</p><p>The Sandbox (SAND) token price observed an all-time high of $3.45 on November 3, up 120% compared to November 1.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sandbox Current Market Value</h2><p>At the time of writing, on November 18, it was $4.14 with a 24-hour trading volume of $4,036,447,004. The Sandbox has been up 19.17% in the last 24 hours.&nbsp;</p><p>The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #50, with a live market cap of $3,694,710,390 USD. It has a circulating supply of 892,246,119 SAND coins and a max. supply of 3,000,000,000 SAND coins.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sand Crypto Price Prediction</h2><p>According to Sandbox’s whitepaper, the centralized control and ownership of the user-generated content in the current game market limit creator rights and ownership.&nbsp;</p><p>Players designed central control over virtual goods trading limits them from making fair value for their creations. Considering these, it can be challenging to prove creative ownership of works, especially as content is copied, altered, and built upon.&nbsp;</p><p>Developers are permitted to scale up their increased strategy and operations with the $93m investment round. This further explains Softbank Vision Fund’s interest in next-generation Internet (<a href=#>Web3</a>) and decentralization.&nbsp;</p><p>The Sandbox Game wrote on Twitter,</p><p><strong>“Adding new strategic partners such as Liberty City Ventures and Galaxy Interactive will also benefit The Sandbox’s global reach and expand the network of brands, IPs, and gaming studios interested in entering an open metaverse focused on a player-owned economy and [user-generated content] UGC”.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Expert Take On The Sandbox Price Prediction</h2><p>Following, we have gathered the most authentic price predictions for The Sandbox (SAND) from popular forecast platforms.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. DigitalCoin SAND Price Forecast&nbsp;</h3><p>In DigitalCoin analysis, the price of The Sandbox cryptocurrency will rise in the next 5 years starting from $3.7632578 as of today’s price to $16.3781938. It will go up to $6.2880957 by 2022 and continue its growth in 2023-2024. Based on this forecast, The Sandbox is a profitable long-term investment. <a href=#>WalletInvestor</a> SAND Price Prediction for 2021, 2023, 2025.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. TradingBeasts SAND Price Prediction&nbsp;</h3><p>Answering the question about if The Sandbox is a good investment, TradingBeasts say a resounding yes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In the 2021 perspective, this coin price is predicted to reach $3.91600, reducing to $3.27482 by the end of 2022.</strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>3. </strong>According to WalletInvestor</h3><p>The Sandbox price will grow from $3.08308 to $3.975 in one year. That makes SAND an awesome investment. The long-term earning potential is 28.93%. Predicted price for the end of 2026 is $8.341.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Decentraland vs. The Sandbox</h2><p>The Sandbox has higher possibility returns but it has more risk. <a href=#>Decentraland</a> is the more reliable investment for long-term holders, as the risk is weaker, and the adoption of the game, which is the most important factor, has come further than for The Sandbox.</p><p>Both Decentraland and The Sandbox are recognized by people interested in decentralized gaming platforms.</p><p><a href=#>Decentraland</a> is the world’s first Ethereum-based virtual world where users build, experiment, and make money from their content and applications.</p><p>This platform has been in the market for a long time and has famously created a metaverse that is loved both by players, developers, and even merchants.</p><p>The Sandbox is also Ethereum-based. This project maintains its decentralized aspects and enables players to buy or rent virtual properties.</p><p>The blend of virtual reality and blockchain is what presents these two platforms and makes them unique.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Better Investment</h3><p>From an investment point of view, both Decentraland and The Sandbox seem good possibilities if you want to invest in “the metaverse“.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Adoption Of Decentraland</h3><p>The Decentraland community is developing fast, reaching many breakthroughs in the past year. The progress is quickening due to lockdowns all over the world-leading people to consume more time online.</p><p>In March of 2021, Decentraland had 10 000 active users, according to the source.</p><p>In addition to regular user adoption, Decentraland has become the “metaverse of choice” for brands seeming to promote themselves.</p><p>Now, brands like Coca-Cola are joining the NFT space and soaking their toes into Decenetraland.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Adoption Of The Sandbox&nbsp;</h3><p>The Sandbox allows players to build its virtual world pixel by pixel, where you can transform anything you create into an NFT.</p><p>This NFT can then be sold either in-game or on exchanges/platforms like OpenSea.</p><p>This leads to much more customization and freedom for the users of The Sandbox.</p><p>While matching these two projects and their characteristics, one must note that Decentraland accepts only the ERC-721 standard, whereas the latter plans to support and implement the ERC-1155 standard in the game in collaboration with Enjin, including the ERC-721.&nbsp;</p><p>They both show dedication, but Decentraland has more inclination and real-world use than Sandbox, which is the key to progress in the cryptocurrency market. Also, Decentraland is less unsafe to hold, maintaining lower potential returns compared to Sandbox.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC%2FwKebm6eoYr2ztcKeZKmqlZm2pMDIqKVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./promise-joshua-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-90471-html.html><span>←</span><span>Promise Joshua Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
