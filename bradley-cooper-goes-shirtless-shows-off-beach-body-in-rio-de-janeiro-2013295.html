On Tuesday, May 29, <a href=#><strong>Bradley Cooper</strong></a>'s Hangover: Part III <a href=#>costars showed off their beach bodies</a> during a group outing to Ipanema Beach in Rio de Janeiro, but the 38-year-old actor, disappointingly, stayed covered up in a t-shirt and shorts. The next day, however, Cooper obliged his fans and showed off his muscular beach body.</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Shirtless hunks</a></p><p>The Oscar-nominated Silver Linings Playbook actor ditched his shirt and went for a dip in the water after working up a sweat hiking. Unlike <a href=#><strong>Zach Galifianakis</strong></a> and <strong>Ed Helms</strong>, who <a href=#>wore tiny Speedos</a> during the earlier beach day, Cooper wore more modest black swim trunks. Cooper bulked up for his role in the 2010 action film, The A-Team, and appeared to be in as equally good of shape.</p><p>Cooper has most recently been romantically linked to 20-year-old model <strong>Suki Waterhouse</strong>. He previously was in a long-term relationship with actress <a href=#><strong>Zoe Saldana</strong>,</a> and, before that, <a href=#><strong>Renee Zellweger</strong></a>. He was also married to actress <strong>Jennifer Esposito</strong> from 2006 to 2007.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In the May issue of Details, the hunky actor said he hopes to have family of his own some day.</p><p>"I really hope I have that experience in my life. I saw how much joy fatherhood gave my own dad," he said of his father, Charles, who passed away in January 2011. "So I hope it's part of my journey. You go through stages in your life, and fatherhood seems like a natural stage."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGabqpGZuabFjJymqKiVp3qou8SsZKygmafBrbHSrGSsoJ%2BswG67xZ9km52RmLVurs6dsGahnmK%2FqruMnZxmopGjsqq%2BzmZpaWljZ4Z2ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./denis-villeneuve-movies.html><span>←</span><span>Box Office Domination: The Highest-Grossing Denis Villeneuve Movies, Ranked</span></a>
