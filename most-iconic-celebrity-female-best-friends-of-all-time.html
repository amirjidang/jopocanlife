The pair met in the 50s when Fitzgerald was trying to score a gig at the Mocambo in Hollywood. It however proved difficult for the singer because of the segregation and racism that existed at the time.</p><p>After learning about the dire situation, Monroe told the club manager she would book a table in the front row every night if Fitzgerald got the gig. She hoped people would come in to see her while also watching Fitzgerald perform. Monroe's plan proved very effective as fans came in everyday to meet her. It was not long before Fitzgerald became a hit.

They were a formidable feminist team, advocating for a cause and complementing each other's strengths. While Anthony could travel around the country as she was not married, Stanton contributed to the cause by writing speeches for her friend. Stanton once wrote, "No power in heaven, hell or earth can separate us, for our hearts are eternally wedded together" The pair remained friends for about five decades until Stanton died. Today, they will forever be remembered as icons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tina-fey-and-amy-poehler><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Tina Fey and Amy Poehler</span></h2><p>Tina and Amy undoubtedly have one of the most iconic friendships in Hollywood.
