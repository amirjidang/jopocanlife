TMZ Sports caught up with the 45-year-old to clarify if rumors were true that his <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234702912>fellow NBA retiree</a> once defecated in his shoes as a prank.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Hell no, that’s a lie, that’s cap and I know T-Lue started that or someone said T-Lue said that,” George told the outlet. “That never happened. I think he did that to someone in Orlando. I don’t remember the dude’s name, but he did that in Orlando. But he never took a sh*t in my shoes … he <a href=# data-type=post data-id=617659>did some pranks</a> but he never sh*tted in nobody shoes or mine.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Had Shaq ever thought to place his feces in his former teammate’s shoes, George jokingly predicted, “Yeah, we’d have to fight. I’d just get beat up. You know? If he sh*tted in my shoes, then it is what it is.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“If somebody sh*t in my shoes, you just gonna have to whoop my ass,” he said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Fellow ex-Laker Tyronn Lue joined&nbsp;Quentin Richardson&nbsp;and&nbsp;Darius Miles’ Knuckleheads podcast back in June and claimed that the prank happened in the early 2000’s. He played alongside George and O’Neal on <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234670552>the Los Angeles team</a> at the time.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">About 26 minutes into his interview, Lue told the co-hosts the origin of the prank.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“So one day Devean George was supposed to get the donuts but he didn’t do it, so Shaq said, ‘Alright, Im’a get you,'” he said. “We getting ready for a game, so Devean George, I think, went and worked out on the court… Shaq goes in the bathroom, takes his shoe in there and he sh*ts in his shoe.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">According to Lue, George put the shoe on and was in for a surprise. He also mentioned the 50-year-old pranking another teammate with feces inside of a magazine. George however, has denied that the prank happened to him.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Attributing Shaq’s early “jock” behavior to him being a vet on the Lakers amongst some rookies, George told TMZ, “He always hid stuff, took stuff — pranks … made us do his errands. Shaq was Shaq but in all, he was a great teammate. He’s a good guy. I love him.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Listen to Devean George deny Shaquille O’Neal taking a crap in his shoe above and T-Lue detailing the 22-year-old prank below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5myt7HAp2SgnZ%2BntKZ5w56lop2jYsCprdCuoKWklWK8r7HApWSpp5%2Bleqq6jKyfqJ1dZn90gJZqbXJvaWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./195545-first-photo-of-steve-austin-in-the-new-film-the-expendables.html><span>←</span><span>First Photo of Steve Austin in the New Film The Expendables</span></a>
