You know, when, when he loses Scarlet, he’s faced with temptation success and, you know, he’s young, he has the opportunity to get over this person, but he never does. And in that it drives him crazy. That is, I just wanted to highlight themes that aren’t made in movies. I’m sick of seeing people like treat love like it’s trivial, right. That we can just move past it. Like, because if it’s real love, you can’t move past it and you shouldn’t move past it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sydney-sweeney-also-worked-with-megan-fox>Sydney Sweeney Also Worked With Megan Fox</h2><p>Apart from working with Machine Gun Kelly on two separate projects, Sydney Sweeney is also no stranger to the musician's finacé.
