In this exclusive clip, journalist <a href=# id=auto-tag_clover-hope data-tag=clover-hope>Clover Hope</a>, The Motherlode‘s author and main narrator, shares how fellow rap pioneers <a href=# id=auto-tag_salt-n-pepa data-tag=salt-n-pepa>Salt-N-Pepa</a> indirectly helped in Lyte’s development as an emcee.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“When MC Lyte started rapping at 14 years old, she sounded like a 14-year-old girl. To deepen her tone, she worked with a vocal coach, Lucien George Sr., whose three sons, the George brothers were members of the R&B group <a href=# id=auto-tag_full-force data-tag=full-force>Full Force</a>, producers of <a href=# id=auto-tag_roxanne-shante-2 data-tag=roxanne-shante-2>Roxanne Shante</a>‘s hit record ‘Roxanne’s Revenge.’ Every Saturday, George Sr. would go to Lyte’s house in Brooklyn and teach her how to manipulate the deeper parts of her voice, using<a href=#> Salt-N-Pepa songs</a> as reference points,” said Hope.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“‘He would tell me to learn a song I really loved,'” she said MC Lyte told VIBE in 2011. “‘I would literally say it over and over again and George would coach me on how to make my voice sound strong. And how to pronounce the words to where someone else would feel it.’ George taught her how to come from the diaphragm, to sound more imposing.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-soundcloud wp-block-embed-soundcloud"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Motherlode: 100+ Women Who Made Hip-Hop highlights the countless women who have influenced and served as pioneers in Hip-Hop culture through their immeasurable contributions. The program is narrated by Hope, Remy Ma, Nia Long, Chlöe Bailey, Lauren London, Janelle James, and Angie Martinez. Told entirely from a woman’s perspective, The Motherlode also includes a fictional installment, archival footage, and music snippets to help tie the chapters together.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">MC Lyte <a href=#>previously spoke with VIBE</a> about the impact her female predecessors have had on her growth and development, as well as being a trailblazer for the women currently running the game today. “It feels good,” Lyte said while being honored by the Recording Industry Association of America last year.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I mean, that’s what it’s all about. It’s a building upon. No one is starting on ground zero. That was done for us a long time ago, and that was Sha-Rock and Pebblee-Poo, and they started from ground zero. And since then, all we’ve been doing is laying bricks, laying bricks, you know. Each of us gets the opportunity to lay some bricks in this wall of prominent women in Hip-Hop.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Listen to The Motherlode: 100+ Women Who Made Hip-Hop<a href=# rel=nofollow> here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5bCpbXBpZysZaSdsm65zq2fnqqcpLGmedKao61lnmK9przAZqCnnpyqsq%2BvxGaknGWcrsGmeZBram1vZ259dH6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adrian-neville-wwe-wrestler-wiki-height-weight-age-girlfriend-family-biography-more.html><span>←</span><span>Adrian Neville (WWE Wrestler) Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</span></a>
