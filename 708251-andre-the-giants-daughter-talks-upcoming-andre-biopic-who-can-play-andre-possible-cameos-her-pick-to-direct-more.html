Who’s going to play my Dad? I think I’ll leave that to the professionals. We are going to have to get a character actor, obviously. I don’t know how they are going to do it exactly. They might do somebody that is tall enough for visual and then have someone&nbsp;do the voice. I don’t know if it’s going to be digital or practical make-up. It will be interesting. He had such a unique look. He had such a unique voice. They are really going to need to pull out a lot of special effects for this.&nbsp;</p><p>On potential cameos from wrestlers Andre worked with or cast members from&nbsp;The Princess Bride:</p><p>Robin: I would say the chances are probably pretty high. The Princess Bride was such a big thing in his life and his career. They are going to have to have other wrestlers depicted in this. I would say there is a pretty good chance. I am sure they will find people to portray them. I don’t know that it will actually be them.&nbsp;</p><p>On who she would like to see direct the movie:</p><p>Robin: My personal choice, in my geekdom, is Joss Whedon. He’s just got such an interesting view of things that I think he could make it a lot of fun. That’s my personal pick but I don’t know who they have in mind.&nbsp;</p><p>On when the movie could be in theaters:</p><p>Robin: It’s going to be a couple of years. They are still finalizing the script and the director. They still have to cast. It’s going to be a couple of years.</p><p>This exclusive starts with WrestleZone Radio’s <a href=#>Nick Hausman</a>&nbsp;also chatting with&nbsp;Robin Christensen-Roussimoff about:</p><ul><li>Working with Stone Village Productions to create a live action movie about the life of her father</li><li>What her role as a consultant on the movie entails</li><li>Shaquille O’Neil appearing in the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal at WrestleMania</li><li>More…</li></ul><p>Nick then jumps over to an interview he did with Lion Forge Comic’s President Geoff Gerber and Lion Forge’s Sales Manager Devin Funches.
