Whether it was a discussion about their age gap or how they met, fans were still intrigued by the couple. However, there are aspects of their relationship people tend to forget about. Here is a list of 10 forgotten facts about Kaia and Pete's short-lived relationship.</p><h2 id=they-met-at-a-fashion-show><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>They Met At A Fashion Show</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kaia and Pete met in May 2019 after <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they walked in the Alexander Wang fashion show</a> in New York City. The pair hit it off as <a href=#><strong>friends</strong></a> but hadn't started dating until several months later, in October 2019. After their initial first meeting, the model and the comedian remained friends and kept in touch. They shared multiple mutual friends, so it was no surprise when the pair became a couple.</p><h2 id=she-had-a-necklace-with-the-letter-p><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>She&nbsp;Had A Necklace With The Letter "P"</span></h2><p>After less than a month of dating, Kaia was spotted on a red carpet in early November 2019 sporting a gold necklace with the letter "P" pendant attached. Several news outlets spotted the piece of jewelry and began reporting on what the "P" could stand for. The new outlets assumed the "P" stood for Pete, and this was Kaia's way of confirming their rumored relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-was-dating-someone-else><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He&nbsp;Was Dating Someone Else</span></h2><p>Before the celebrity duo met, Pete was already <a href=#>quietly dating actress Margaret Qualley</a>. Their relationship was confirmed in August 2019. The breakup was reported a couple of months later, in October. It seems Pete and Kaia may have developed a close bond while he was seeing Qualley.</p><h2 id=she-was-attracted-to-his-personality><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She&nbsp;Was Attracted To His Personality</span></h2><p>After it was confirmed that they were officially dating, it was revealed Kaia gave Pete a chance after she was intrigued by his personality. In October 2019, he and Kaia began</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kaia Gerber Breaks Her Wrist - Does Her Cast Cover Her New Self-Inked Tattoo?</a></span></p><p>spending more alone time together, and she realized he is a lot more charming than she thought. She kept it under wraps at the beginning of the relationship, but clearly, they were taken with each other.</p><h2 id=he-visited-her-in-malibu><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>He Visited Her In Malibu</span></h2><p>In early November of 2019, Pete and Kaia were spotted in Malibu, where the couple headed to Nobu to enjoy a nice romantic dinner together. However, several news outlets confirmed the dinner date was not romantic, and the two were hanging out as friends. As they were leaving the restaurants, they were seen getting into Pete's car, where the pair <a href=#>looked at each other and began to giggle</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-had-their-first-date-in-nyc><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>They Had Their First Date In NYC</span></h2><p>The couple was first spotted together in NYC at Sadelle's, a popular restaurant in the city. However, when they were seen out together, there were no signs of a relationship. Kaia and Pete seemed into each other, but there was no hugging or kissing between the two. A fan was able to get a sneaky picture of the two where they are seen laughing together.</p><h2 id=vacationed-in-miami><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Vacationed In Miami</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A few weeks after rumors began to spread about a potential relationship, Kaia and Pete <a href=#>were spotted in Miami</a> together. They were seen getting cozy by the pool, clearly looking</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kaia Gerber Reveals Friendship With 'The Bachelor's' Kit Keenan</a></span></p><p>like a couple. The pair were in Miami together to attend a friend's wedding. The Miami&nbsp;sighting is when their relationship was confirmed to the public.</p><h2 id=age-difference><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Age Difference</span></h2><p>Many fans tend to forget just how much of an age gap there was between Kaia and Pete. At the time that they were dating, Pete was 26, and Kaia had just turned 18. Kaia's parents, Cindy Crawford and Randy Gerber, <a href=#>did express concern over the age gap</a> in the relationship. However, the couple trusted their daughter enough to make the right choices in her dating life. Seeing as Kaia is so young, they hoped the relationship who eventually fizzle out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=broke-up-after-three-months><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Broke Up After&nbsp;Three Months</span></h2><p>Their break up was announced on January 15, 2020, in <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, after only three months together. The announcement of the split did not come as a surprise to fans seeing as just a few weeks earlier, Pete was spotted leaving Kaia's NYC apartment shortly after her parents, who were in a heated exchange. Several onlookers believed Cindy and Randy were concerned about Kaia's well-being while in the relationship.</p><h2 id=relationship-got-too-intense><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Relationship Got Too Intense</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kaia is reportedly the one who decided to end the relationship after he got too intense for her. A source close to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> said, "It got very overwhelming for Kaia. Pete has a certain M.O. and he’s very intense to his girlfriends. Kaia is only 18 and it’s a lot to deal with." Prior to the split, Pete had jokingly spoken about attending a "vacation" that insurance pays for. It seems&nbsp;<a href=#>the relationship became too serious for Kaia</a> and she decided to cut the cord.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Anya Taylor Joy Was Doing This When She Was Scouted As A Model</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidqKqXpMG1sc1mnZqbpKh6oq7Orqtmo5Germ6zxKuZnqpdlrulec%2Beq55llJbDqrDSqKWsZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wisin-yandel-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Wisin Yandel Net Worth How Much is Wisin Yandel Worth?</span></a>
