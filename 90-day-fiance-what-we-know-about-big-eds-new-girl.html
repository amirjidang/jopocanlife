The California-based&nbsp;photographer from TLC’s&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">90 Day Fiancé</a>&nbsp;</strong>shocked fans when he insinuated that Rose might have an STD in front of millions of viewers. Not a good look, Ed! Obviously, the pair is totally over, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Ed’s love life</a> is somehow not. Recently, the photographer posted a shot of a very special woman, even leaving&nbsp;a coy remark in the comments section about having moved on from Rose.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, fans are beginning to wonder about the identity of the mysterious gal. Who is Big Ed’s new love interest? And what exactly is the nature of their relationship? Read on for the inside scoop:</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘90 Day Fiancé’: Big Ed Has Klipper-Feil Syndrome, But What Is The Condition?</a></span></p><h2 id=ed-amp-diane-more-than-friends>Ed & Diane, ‘More Than Friends’</h2><p>Big Ed stirred up some major drama earlier this week when he posted a now-deleted photo to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his Instagram account</a>. The picture featured Ed posing for the camera cheek-to-cheek with a stunning lady named Diane. In the caption, the photographer left a message to the woman in question. “Good friends are easy to lose but hard to find. Glad to have you back D,” he wrote, according to a previous report we did here at&nbsp;TheThings.&nbsp;But are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two just friends</a>?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/F67A1826-8ADB-4E2F-8F6A-95CBCCFEB5B9.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The answer to that question is a ‘hard no.’ The best part is that it was Big Ed himself who spilled the tea to a curious Insta follower. It all started when a fan left a comment below the post. “‘Friends?’ Unfortunate bro,” the social media user wrote. Big Ed went ahead and left a juicy reply. “More like ‘red heart emoji,’” the photographer confirmed. So is there love in the air? It definitely seems possible.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">90 Day Fiancé: Ariela Is Left In The Cold At Avi’s Baptism</a></span></p><h2 id=but-who-is-she>But Who Is She?</h2><p>Unlike Big Ed’s&nbsp;last romance, which was painfully public, Diane seems to prefer life away from the prying eyes of millions. Not only is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her Instagram account private</a>, but she also selected an avatar&nbsp;for her own profile picture. Basically, she is all about keeping things on the DL. But does that mean that we will never get to know her? Not exactly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/8B3D24E1-1824-4962-AA13-99C247DE8F51.jpeg><p>Big Ed has gone ahead and shared several posts with Diane, revealing what kinds of activities the stunning woman enjoys in her free time. In one recent post, Diane is hanging out with Big Ed and some friends at a San Diego bar. With her Dos Equis beer in hand, she shows her taste for the simple things. However, in her black bralette, Diane proves that she’s not afraid to take a risk or two. Good to know!</p><p>But will we see Diane in a future&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé&nbsp;spinoff?&nbsp;Screen Rant&nbsp;reports that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Ed has been spotted filming</a>... and that he had a companion. So, could that special someone be Diane? It’s still too soon to tell. We will have to tune into TLC to find out for sure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘90 Day Fiancé’: Are Brittany And Yazan Finally Ready To Get Married?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhwaWWUlsZussiapZydXay1osCMsJxmo56kxG6twaisrWWSnrRuscOsZKedp2K0qr7LaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./20-celebs-who-will-never-get-a-job-outside-their-cw-show.html><span>←</span><span>20 Celebs Who Will Never Get A Job Outside Their CW Show</span></a>
