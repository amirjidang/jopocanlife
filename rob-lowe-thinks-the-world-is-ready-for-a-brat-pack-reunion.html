Decades after those movies made Lowe a major star, he’s eyeing a potential reunion of the former teen idols.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rob-Lowe-Thinks-World-Is-Ready-Brat-Pack-Reunion-001.jpg><p>“It’s funny, I think the world needs some iteration of it!” the <a href=#>West Wing</a> alum said during a conversation with Good Day New York‘s Rosanna Scotto on Monday, January 18. “There is not enough in the world to make fun of, I think the Brat Pack should volunteer.”</p><p>While Lowe doesn’t have an idea totally ironed out yet, he thinks <a href=#>a modern-day Brat Pack project</a> should “be something weird and offbeat and quirky,” instead of a traditional reboot. “Is it a cartoon? Like a version of Scooby-Doo? I don’t know,” he joked. “But hey, why not. … [Or] how about Brat Pack as Big Brother? How about that?”</p><p>Lowe’s rise to fame in the Brat Pack-era wasn’t a smooth ride. During a recent interview on <a href=#>Sunday Today With Willie Geist</a>, the 9-1-1: Lone Star actor recalled <a href=#>struggling with substance abuse</a> at 18 and reflected on his journey to sobriety.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rob-Lowe-Thinks-World-Is-Ready-Brat-Pack-Reunion-002.jpg><p>“Nobody’s going to do a pity party or have a telethon for all those suffering 18-year-old movie stars, you know?” he said on Sunday, January 17, noting that there’s always “that person in the culture” going through a similar struggle. “You either come out on the other side of it way, way, way better, or way, way, way worse, I think.”</p><p>Over the last 30 years, Lowe has done his best to stay sober and set an example for his sons — <a href=#><strong>Matthew</strong></a>, 27, and <a href=#><strong>John Owen</strong></a>, 26. In April 2020, Lowe’s youngest son revealed that he had just marked two years of sobriety. Three months prior, the “Literally! With Rob Lowe” podcast host opened up about working alongside John Owen, who wrote for the <a href=#>first season of 9-1-1: Lone Star</a>.</p><p>“I have multiple moments now where he comes up to me like, ‘Hey Rob, I’m going to cut this line and then we’re going to transpose this and move this, but you need to leave a little more air there,'” the Emmy nominee told Us Weekly and other reporters during the 2020 Television Critics’ Association press tour. “And I’m like, ‘OK, great.’ And then it was just like, ‘That was my kid!’ It’s more satisfying than I ever thought it would be.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmoml2hvLixjK2foqabqHq1tMRmrqiqnJl6qr%2BMq5yanKlis7C%2BjJpkm6qRqXqxrcKkZKudpaO2sLqO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ricky-starks-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Ricky Starks Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
