He grew up loving music and began to rap in the Korean underground hip hop scene in the early 2000s.</p><p>After gaining popularity in doses for several years, Simon finally broke into the mainstream music industry where he formed a duo with E-Sens in a group called ‘Supreme Team’ under the management of Amoeba Culture. The pair debuted in 2009 with an EP titled Supreme Team Guide To Excellent Adventure. They received a Mnet Asian Music Award (MAMA) for the Best New Male Group following their debut and was on Mnet’s 20 Most influential Stars of 2010. They also won the ‘Hip Hop Award’ at the Golden Disk 2010 Awards.</p><p>Supreme Team had so much potential, however, it was truncated when E-Sens was sentenced to 2 years of probation for smoking marijuana. This prompted Simon to launch his solo career in 2011 by releasing his album titled Simon Dominic Presents: SNL League Begins which peaked at number 2 on the Gaon Album Chart.</p><p>Although the band came together to perform two new songs at the 2013 Amoebahood concert, they disbanded the same year after E-Sens’ contract was terminated. Simon himself went on to leave the record label.</p><p>In 2014, Simon Dominic collaborated with Jay Park to form a new record label called AOMG where he consequently continued to release songs as a solo artist. Although he resigned from his position as co-CEO of AOMG in July 2018, he has remained signed to the label as a rapper.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=height-and-other-interesting-facts></span> <strong>Height and </strong><strong>Other Interesting Facts</strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h4><strong>Height</strong></h4><p>The hip-hop recording artist has an average height that fits his overall stature as he is reported to stand at 5 feet 7 inches (170cm) tall.</p><h4><strong>Choice of Name</strong></h4><p>When he began to rap, Simon was first known by the name K-OUTA. As his career progressed, he changed his name to Simon Dominic which is a combination of his baptismal name ‘Dominic’ and actor Wesley Snipes‘ character in the movie Demolition Man, Simon.</p><p>Moreover, having an English stage name has opened up doors in his career on many levels.</p><h4><strong>Career Successes</strong></h4><p>Simon Dominic has been very successful since he began to concentrate on his solo career in earnest. He was nominated for ‘Best Rap Performance at the 13th Mnet Asian Music Awards in 2011.</p><p>In 2015, he released his first extended play titled Won & Only. The first single on the album which is ironically named after him achieved what has been described as an “all-kill”, meaning it reached the #1 spot on all South Korean’s major music charts. This is a feat that hasn’t been achieved in a long while. The song later peaked at number 2 on the weekly Gaon Digital Chart.</p><p>Simon also appeared on the rap competition TV Show, Show Me the Money 5 in 2016. He was a producer and a judge alongside Gray (an AOMG artist). Their team member – Bewhy- won the show.</p><p>In 2018, Simon Dominic won the Korean Popular Music Awards in the Hip Hop Award category.</p><h4><strong>Music Helps with His Insomnia</strong></h4><p>Aside from Simon’s love for music, his career choice has proven to be very therapeutic as he sometimes finds it difficult to sleep. During this time, he is able to concentrate on his craft, thus making it somewhat of a win-win situation.</p><h4><strong>Simon Dominic is a Very Creative Person</strong></h4><p>Simon is very creative when it comes to his music. He is involved in the creative process of all the work he churns out from writing the lyrics to creating the beats. He has revealed that when making music, he writes his lyrics first as it flows and comes to him before adding the beat.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKuZoryvecOopKKmmZh6o7XOZpignV2dsqqzx61kmqaUYry1tMSrZKKmpJq%2Fpr%2FToqWgZZaWsLW%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./salaries-of-state-of-iowa-employees.html><span>←</span><span>Salaries of State of Iowa Employees Earnings and Hourly Wages</span></a>
