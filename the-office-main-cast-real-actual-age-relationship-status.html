If you haven't started the show or you want to rewatch the series we would suggest you start ASAP!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#>10 Ridiculously Expensive Things Kaley Cuoco Has Bought</a></span></p><p>With The Office&nbsp;coming to an end on Netflix and NBC taking back the rights of the show, this caused us to think about all the characters in the show we love so much, what they are up to and who they are up to it with. Here are the <a href=#>main characters of the show</a>'s real age and relationship status.</p><h2 id=steve-carell--57-amp-married>Steve Carell- 57 & Married</h2><p>Oh, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the world's best boss</a>! Or the worst boss, you decide. The boss that would make us laugh so hard, but also cringe from all the awkwardness. Steve Carell who played Michael Scott on the show was born on August 16, 1962, making him 57 years old. He and his wife Nancy have been married since August of 1995.</p><p>Something amazing about his wife is that Nancy actually played one of Michael's girlfriends (Carol) for several episodes. She ended up breaking up with him when he made a Christmas card where he put his face over her ex-husband's face. Oh, Michael, when will you learn?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=john-krasinski--40-amp-married>John Krasinski- 40 & Married</h2><p>Who didn't love Jim? He was the dorky guy with the shaggy hair that we wanted so badly to marry Pam. Even though John isn't playing Jim anymore he has tons of projects he's working on at the moment including The Quiet Place 2 that's coming out this year.</p><p>John was born on October 20, 1979, and married the beautiful Emily Blunt in 2010. Emily Blunt is a very talented and successful actress that appears in several movies including the reboot of Mary Poppins last year.</p><h2 id=jenna-fischer--45-amp-married>Jenna Fischer- 45 & Married</h2><p>Jenna Fischer played the cute receptionist Pam who we all cheered for when she ended up not marrying her fiance, Roy. Jenna Fischer was born on March 7, 1974, making her 45 years old. She has been married to Lee Kirk since 2010.</p><p>Before that, she was married to James Gunn for 8 years who is famous for directing the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. Lee Kirk who she is currently married to is also a director.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rainn-wilson--53-amp-married>Rainn Wilson- 53 & Married</h2><p>Rainn Wilson played Michael Scott's sidekick, Dwight. Dwight and Jim were always fighting (with Jim mostly winning). Rainn Wilson was born on January 20, 1966, making him 53 years old.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How To Spot A Fake Designer Handbag: 10 Tell-Tale Signs Yours Might Be Fake</a></span></p><p>He and Steve Carell have actually <a href=#>been married</a> the exact same amount of time, with Rainn marrying Holiday Reinhorn in 1995. This means he and his wife have been married for over 25 years. What an accomplishment!</p><h2 id=angela-kinsey--48-amp-married>Angela Kinsey- 48 & Married</h2><p>Angela got to keep her name on the show but played a character much different from her real-life personality. In real-life Angela is very bubbly and outgoing, but in the show, Angela plays everyone's favorite stickler.</p><p>Angela was born on June 25, 1971, making her 48 years old. She has been married to Josh Snyder who is also a fellow actor since 2016. When Josh and Angela were married it was more than just a union between them two, but the start of their beautiful blended family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=oscar-nunez--61-amp-married>Oscar Nunez- 61 & Married</h2><p>Who will ever forget the episode where Oscar ( who also got to keep his real name ) came out gay and Michael kissed him? So uncomfortable. Oscar Nunez was born on November 18, 1958, making him 61 years old.</p><p>Oscar has been married to his wife Ursula Whittaker since 2011. The couple shares a daughter together named August.</p><h2 id=bj-novak--40-amp-single>BJ Novak- 40 & Single</h2><p>Okay, so BJ Novak isn't actually together with Mindy Kaling (pictured here) also from The Office,&nbsp;but our question is why not? Rumors about this couple are still happening even with the show ending years ago.</p><p>BJ and Mindy were both writers on the show and also played on-screen on again and off again lovers. They were the obnoxious couple you wanted to hate, but couldn't. Even though they aren't actually together, we can dream, right? BJ Novak was born on July 31, 1979, making him 40 years old. He began writing for the show in his early 20's!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brian-baumgartner--47-amp-married>Brian Baumgartner- 47 & Married</h2><p>Brian plays the hilarious Kevin in The Office.&nbsp;He didn't always mean to be funny, but he always made us laugh. Brian was born on November 29, 1972, making him 47 years old. He married Celeste Ackleson in 2014.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Celebrities That Get The Most Money For A Sponsored Post</a></span></p><p>The couple shares a daughter Brylee, born in 2015, together. Now we don't know much about Celeste since she doesn't have any social media presence, but they seem incredibly happy together!</p><h2 id=kate-flannery--55-amp-in-a-relationship>Kate Flannery- 55 & In a relationship</h2><p>Kate played Meredith on the show probably most famous for her drinking problems and her iffy parenting. But, in real life, Kate seems like things are going good for her. Kate was born on June 10, 1964, making her 55 years old. She has been with her longtime partner Chris Haston since 2006.</p><p>Chris and Kate met on the set of The Office since he use to work for NBC. Rumors have come and gone about them being married, but nothing has been confirmed. They are definitely together though and seem to be still going strong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=leslie-baker--61---divorced-amp-single>Leslie Baker- 61 - Divorced & Single?</h2><p>Leslie Baker who played grumpy Stanley on the show is living a life of mystery. Leslie was born on February 19, 1958, making him 61 years old. We know at some point he was married since he brought his wife to the 2010 SAG awards, but we aren't quite sure what is happening now.</p><p>Leslie wanted to keep his life very private so he never disclosed his wife's name and most of the reports now are saying he is divorced and living in a secluded house near the everglades. Most reports say that he has been divorced for a couple of years since he cheated on her. This is ironic since that was the storyline for his character Stanley. Either way, we hope Leslie is relaxing and enjoying the retired life.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Most Expensive Vegan Restaurants In The United States</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5npJ2ybrvFn6CcnV2irqq6jJyYrKxdp7KiuIyamq2tkaF6orPEZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWWjqa61wdJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./most-iconic-celebrity-female-best-friends-of-all-time.html><span>←</span><span>The Most Iconic Celebrity Female Best Friends Of All Time</span></a>
