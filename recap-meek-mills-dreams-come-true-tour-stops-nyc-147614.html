He has loosened up considerable (although he still love to scream) and seemed to be genuinely having fun during fan favorites like “House Party,” “Actin’ Up” and “Amen.” Still a fan himself, he showed off his cute dance skills during the break when he bopped around to other rappers’ songs like Kanye’s “Mercy” and Drake’s “I’m On One.” At one point, Meek showed his love for the ladies by putting his money where his mouth was, literally handing out bills to attractive women from the sizeable bundle he kept in his pocket. “”I like seeing pretty girls come to my concert and look like a bag of money,” he grinned.</p><p>Meek’s protégé, freestyle rapper Lil Snupe, came out at one point to spit two off-the-head verses. Meek pointed out that Snupe was far superior to fellow Philly rapper Cassidy, with whom he’s had public issues with, and then upped the ante, saying that he would put up $100,000 for anyone who wanted to battle Snupe. The Cassidy bashing continued in a free verse Meek spit as well.</p><p>Though the crowd was largely filled with ardent Meek fans, Diddy and girlfriend Cassie were spotted in V.I.P. enjoying the show. Diddy closed the show by surprising Meek with a guest cameo onstage, giving the young gunner the hometown stamp of approval. –Sowmya Krishnamurthy</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6eypK3PZqSenZtiuqq4y6xknaqVlrq0ecKopJ5lpKfCpnnTqKyrZaOpvLG%2FjKewnGVhaYR3fZNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mahershala-ali-netflix-chimp-empire-1234744196.html><span>←</span><span>Mahershala Ali Set To Narrate Netflix Wildlife Series</span></a>
