The Real Madrid and France striker has won both La Liga and the Champions League during the past few years, during which time he has scored goals and assisted his teammates in the process of winning both competitions. The fact that Benzema was awarded the Ballon d'Or despite the fact that he only played in 31 league games and contributed to 39 goals is not surprising. But how should he commemorate this momentous occasion?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given <a href=#>Karim's affluent lifestyle</a> and passion for cars, he may decide to add a new vehicle to his already incredible collection. Not surprisingly, the world's best footballer owns some of the world's most luxurious cars. Karim Benzema has won everything on the field, and he has amassed an impressive collection of elegant and incredibly fast cars. Let’s take a peek inside Karim Benzema’s insane car collection.</p><h2 id=bugatti-chiron>Bugatti Chiron</h2><p>Benzema is a self-proclaimed "bit of a petrolhead" who is the proud owner of some extremely spectacular cars. One of these is the Bugatti Chiron, which has an astounding price tag of $2.5 million. This beauty is equipped with an 8.0-liter, 16-cylinder engine that can only be characterized as a beast. It accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 2.3 seconds and has a maximum speed of 261 mph. That is pretty impressive speed in a short period of time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rolls-royce>Rolls-Royce</h2><p>It is true that most <a href=#>wealthy and renowned individuals have a Rolls-Royce</a>. There is no other option. Even if people don't get a say in the matter, that seems to be the general consensus. Benzema also seemed to know this. After all, he drives about in a sophisticated white Rolls-Royce that retails for close to $250,000 and unquestionably exudes success. However, the authorities arrested him once when he was driving it without a license and going faster than the speed limit.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Clooney Garage: Inside George Clooney’s Insane Car Collection</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bugatti-veyron>Bugatti Veyron</h2><p>It's obvious that Karim needs more than one Bugatti in his insane car collection. Additionally, he is the proud owner of a highly exclusive Bugatti Veyron, which is estimated to have cost somewhere in the range of $1.5 million. The Veyron boasts a 1001 hp engine and 16 cylinders, making it a <a href=#>super-powerful car</a>. Despite weighing 4,052 pounds, it can hit 60 mph in 2.5 seconds. If this is not enough for you, you can also watch Benzema drive the Veyron and a number of other amazing cars by going to his YouTube channel.</p><h2 id=ferrari-458-spyder>Ferrari 458 Spyder</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clearly not content with merely driving Bugattis, France's no. 9 prefers to drive Ferraris too. Karim drives one of the most impressive sports cars available, a Ferrari 458 Spyder. It boasts 570 hp and a 4.5-liter engine that is capable of going almost exactly 200 mph. The 458 Spyder costs approximately $250,000, a fraction compared to the extravagant Bugattis in Karim's garage.</p><h2 id=mercedes-benz-slr-mclaren>Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren</h2><p>Benzema is the proud owner of one of the 1,200 Mercedes-Benz SLR McLarens that have been produced; he got his hands on it recently. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The M155 SLR V8</a> supercharges its 5.4-liter engine, allowing it to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in approximately 3.5 seconds. When it comes to aesthetics, the McLaren SLR is difficult to surpass thanks to its wing doors and its sleek overall design. It is undeniable that this car fits in perfectly with the rest of Karim's cars in terms of both appearance and performance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Peek Inside Tom Hardy's Insane Car Collection</a></span></p><h2 id=audi-rs6>Audi RS6</h2><p>Fans have not witnessed Benzema cruising around in his Audi RS6 for a significant amount of time. It's possible that the football player has never driven the car again after he crashed in an accident. The Audi RS6 is considerably less expensive than his other luxury cars. There is a possibility that the football player drives an Audi RS6 as a result of the endorsement arrangement that exists between his football club, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Madrid, and Audi motors</a>.</p><h2 id=lamborghini-gallardo>Lamborghini Gallardo</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Lamborghini Gallardo is a popular choice among professional football players, like Karim Benzema. Karim Benzema enjoys riding about in his Lamborghini, which has a maximum speed of 202 mph. He is aware that getting people's attention is going to be easy if he drives around in a red Lamborghini. In addition to Benzema, football legend Robinho had one when playing for Manchester City, as did Wayne Rooney. The 5.2-liter V10 engine that boasts excellent precise power can be found at the very center of the Lamborghini Gallardo supercar's mid-engine layout. One can experience expert motorsport handling and performance on the road, with up to 570 hp and 397 pound-feet of torque at their disposal.</p><h2 id=audi-q5>Audi Q5</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A football player can benefit greatly from brand endorsement. Particularly if you <a href=#>play for Real Madrid</a> and Audi is interested in you. Due to marketing experts, Benzema has been spotted in the Q5, Audi's standard SUV. Every component of the Audi Q5 bears the signature Q design and expresses power and motion. This features the characteristic hood and gently sloping roofline, as well as the shoulder-mounted mirrors and the thin window line. This is why Benzema enjoys driving this automobile.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The Off-White Story: How Virgil Abloh's Dream Became A Big Success</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Auto & Cell</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carmoola</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8BmmZ6mqpq6onnGmqman5Virm68xJ6iZqGeqLalsYybmKWkn6N6pbvRZq6ipp6av263wKugpmWSmru7scyaqmahnqiur7GMnJirZZOkua2xwq2gqKZf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-under-eye-creams-dark-circles.html><span>←</span><span>23 Best Under Eye Creams for Dark Circles</span></a>
