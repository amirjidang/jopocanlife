Mostly because he was adamant about never wanting to tie the knot again. But <a href=#>Beth Ostrosky changed his mind</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beth, who he's been with for over 20 years, is easily one of the reasons why Howard is a changed man. She's also universally beloved, even by those who've never listened to a minute of The Howard Stern Show. This is due to her dedication to animal activism and her work with various charities, including North Shore Animal League.</p><p>Howard's second, current (and likely final wife) is also beloved by the gaggle of strange Stern Show staffers that the former shock jock has made famous. But is the love returned? Here's what we know about Beth Stern's relationships with the likes of Gary Dell'Abate, Ronnie Mund, Sal Governale, and the other woman in her husband's life, Robin Quivers.</p><h2 id=beth-stern-39-s-relationship-with-robin-quivers><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Beth Stern's Relationship With Robin Quivers</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Robin Quivers is easily the most important person in Howard's life outside of his immediate family. For over 40 years, the pair have been working together. And, as they've both stated numerous times, they are exceptionally close.</p><p>Fortunately, Beth's feelings for Robin are nearly as strong. While Robin hasn't spent any time with Howard during the pandemic, she has hung out with her colleague and his wife many, many times prior.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Beth Stern Changed Howard's Show And His Relationship With His Daughter, Emily</a></span></p><p>"You are our family," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beth said to Robin in a touching Extra interview</a> about her battle with cancer.</p><p>The affection felt between Beth and Robin is easy to recognize every time the former appears on The Stern Show. Their closeness is also the reason why Robin can publicly challenge Beth when they have a difference of opinion. But they also tend to team up against Howard which results in terrific radio.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While there could be tension and competition between them, there's absolutely no question that Beth Stern and Robin Quivers adore one another.</p><h2 id=beth-stern-39-s-relationship-with-sal-governale><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Beth Stern's Relationship With Sal Governale</span></h2><p>Sal may have forever destroyed any possibility of having a personal relationship with Beth when he took shots at her during the Gary Dell'Abate Roast in 2005. Of course, this wasn't the only time he absolutely stepped in it as far as the love of his boss' wife is concerned.</p><p>At one stage, <a href=#>Sal tried to insert himself into a conflict between Howard and Beth</a> which resulted in him being absolutely ripped to shreds on air. Then there was the whole ordeal of him getting banned from attending their wedding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In recent years, the phony-phone caller, writer, and producer, has calmed down significantly resulting in a more positive relationship between him and Beth. But his wacky beliefs, such as dimes being messages from the dead, have caused Beth to tease him both on-air and in private.</p><h2 id=beth-stern-39-s-relationship-with-richard-christy><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Beth Stern's Relationship With Richard Christy</span></h2><p>Everyone loves Richard, including Beth. While she has understandably been grossed out by some of his antics on air, Beth has admitted to really liking him personally. She even got to spend an entire day with Richard not long after he was first hired on The Stern Show. This, of course, was the famous head-to-toe make-over bit that ultimately turned around Richard's entire image.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of this, Beth and Howard took Richard out for dinner on Thanksgiving in 2005 as they heard he was alone. Of course, this was a very rare occurrence given that Howard is notoriously hermit-like.</p><h2 id=beth-stern-39-s-relationship-with-gary-dell-39-abate><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Beth Stern's Relationship With Gary Dell'Abate</span></h2><p>Aside from Robin, Beth has probably spent the most time with long-time Stern Show producer Gary 'Ba Ba Booey' Dell'Abate and his wife, Mary. This includes the famous dinner party at Gary's house where Howard caused a scene. Beth shared her embarrassment for her husband's behavior on air, but this was far from the only time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Howard Stern's Wife Was Furious Over How He Treated One Of His Staffers</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beth has both publicly and privately challenged Howard on his treatment of Gary. On one occasion, she was so mad at Howard for being mean to Gary that she fought with him until he apologized.</p><h2 id=beth-stern-39-s-relationship-with-benjy-bronk><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Beth Stern's Relationship With Benjy Bronk</span></h2><p>There's no question that Benjy is one of the most controversial figures on The Howard Stern Show. Mostly because his shtick tends to rub a lot of listeners (and Howard himself) the wrong way.</p><p>Beth, however, has defended Benjy on multiple occasions. When Howard and the gang have beaten up Benjy for his looks, Beth has always stated that she thinks he has a nice face. In 2016, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when asked about Benjy</a>, Beth stated, "I like Benjy. Poor Benjy."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beth-stern-39-s-relationship-with-ronnie-mund><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Beth Stern's Relationship With Ronnie Mund</span></h2><p>While Beth has been open about being disgusted by a number of Ronnie "The Limo Driver" Mund's famous s*x tips. According to Howard, Beth has been shocked to hear some of Ronnie's tips out of context when walking by her husband's home office.</p><p>But Ronnie's skillset has also come in handy for Beth. Particularly, when she purchased a few adult toys for Jimmy Kimmel's birthday. The gag gift ended up being one of Jimmy's all-time favorites. And, in part, this was due to Ronnie personally assisting Beth in researching and purchasing the wide array of strange and popular bedroom devices.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ronnie Mund Can't Stopping Fighting With These Howard Stern Show Staffers</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"[Ronnie] at one point had to go into his boxes of all the stuff after his move and find one of the items so we could find the manufacturer and he did," Beth said on air. "He told me to add l*be to complete the gift, so I added a bunch of bottles."</p><p>Unlike many of the other staffers, Beth has actually spent time with Ronnie as he's driven both her and her husband around in the early days.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK%2BRp7Fuv9OeqaerXay2p7GMm5ytoF2kerTAwJ%2BdnqqjYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-spell-resume-for-job-2.html><span>←</span><span>How to spell resume for job</span></a>
