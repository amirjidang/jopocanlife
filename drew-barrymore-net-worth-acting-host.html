As such, it’s hardly surprising that her net worth today stands at an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">impressive $125 million</a>.</p><p>Throughout her over four-decade-long career span, Barrymore has landed several major roles, such as playing Casey Becker in the Scream franchise, having also starred and produced in the ever-so-popular Charlie’s Angels flick in 2000.</p><p>It’s believed that the 48-year-old is one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood, having made as much as $10 million per film while also growing her own production company, Flower Films.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Drew Barrymore's Talk Show Salary The Main Reason She Brought It Back During The Strike?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from her acting career, however, Barrymore is also an exceptional businesswoman who makes a generous income from multiple sources outside of the lucrative deals she’s used to signing with film studios - so how exactly has her net worth skyrocketed to $125 million? Here’s the lowdown.</p><p><strong>Updated September 2023:</strong> Drew Barrymore may not be acting as much as she was in her earlier years or even after she founded Flower Films. This has to do with the fact that the mother-of-two wants to spend as much time as possible with her girls. Because of this, Barrymore took on the duties of a daytime talk show host so that there was stability in her schedule.</p><p>Not only is Barrymore hosting The Drew Barrymore Show but she is also producing it. As such, there is more money to be made for more duties on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether Barrymore's show will continue to be successful though, remains to be seen. This is because the decision was made for the show to return amid the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Many in the industry feel like Barrymore may be committing professional suicide by hosting the show during the months-long strikes.</p><p>Just how this will affect Barrymore's net worth remains to be seen.</p><h2 id=drew-barrymore-rsquo-s-earnings>Drew Barrymore’s Earnings</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/drew-barrymore-3.jpg><p>After gaining recognition for her role in Altered States, it wasn’t long before Barrymore would sign on for another big project, which was none other than Steven Spielberg’s E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.</p><p>Her work for the forthcoming years was mostly low-budget movies. Soon after that though in 1995, Barrymore was cast as Sugar in Batman Forever, which propelled her to become a household name in her adult years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The movie role was far from any of the characters she’d played in the past, so it also allowed fans to see just how diverse she was with her talent.</p><p>Barrymore has always been an actor who would prefer to take more independent film roles or smaller roles that she finds interesting rather than take a big payday for the sake of it. However, at the height of her career around 2006, it was not uncommon for Barrymore to make $10 million or more for a movie.</p><p>Some of the higher-paying films Drew Barrymore has been in include:</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Charlie's Angels (Film)</p></td><td><p>2000</p></td><td><p>Role: Dylan Sanders</p></td><td><p>$9 million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Charlie's Angels (Film)</p></td><td><p>2003</p></td><td><p>Role: Dylan Sanders</p></td><td><p>$14 million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Music and Lyrics (Film)</p></td><td><p>2007</p></td><td><p>Role: Sophie Fisher</p></td><td><p>$15 million</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To put into perspective, the year that Barrymore starred in Music and Lyrics alongside Hugh Grant, her fellow industry peers <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> and <a href=#>Sandra Bullock</a>, were both making $15 million per film at the time as well. That shows just how in-demand Barrymore became in a short time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>According To Drew Barrymore, The Only Father Figure In Her Life Is Billionaire Steven Spielberg</a></span></p><p>However, over the years as a result of wanting to be involved in her children's lives, that changed given that Barrymore chose not to work as much.</p><p>When Barrymore signed on to star as Sheila Hammond in Netflix’s Santa Clarita Diet in 2017, she was juggling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">motherhood</a><a href=#> and homeschooling</a> with work. As such, she ultimately decided that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she would take whatever amount that the streaming giant would pay</a> her.</p><p>"But when I [found myself] all of a sudden a single mum, I kind of had to go back to work and I didn’t know how to do that with kids and I was in a freak spiral," Barrymore explained. "So when I got this show, I was like, 'I’ll take whatever you can give me.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s unclear what she made in the first series, but she was able to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">renegotiate</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> her contract when a second and third season were issued,</a> which saw the actress’ numbers move up to $350,000 per episode.</p><p>"I think I'm just so [nervous] to ever go back to having no career," Barrymore said. " I know what it's like to be told, 'You're done for awhile, sit on ice in the black-list corner.' And I revived my career -- I started producing and having success with films for, like 20 years and then I had kids and stepped back. Then on seasons two and three, I was like, 'Maybe I'm of value to this show.'"</p><h2 id=drew-barrymore-becomes-a-movie-producer>Drew Barrymore Becomes A Movie Producer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/drew-barrymore-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Producing movies has been another strong source of income for Barrymore, who launched her production company Flower Films with the help of Nancy Juvonen in 1995.
