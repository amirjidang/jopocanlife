Pretty Little Liars ran for seven seasons on the network Freeform, and the story was based off a book series of the same name.

Many rumors were started about Hale and her other cast mates, most of which were not true. Hale opened up in a recent podcast that though the four of them certainly went through some rough patches throughout the filming process, ultimately there is a lot of love between them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lucy-hale-39-s-eating-disorder-started-while-filming-pretty-little-liars>Lucy Hale's Eating Disorder Started While Filming Pretty Little Liars</h2><p>The pressure of fitting in with her Pretty Little Liars co-stars and suddenly being launched into fame was a lot for actress Lucy Hale to deal with. While on the Call Her Daddy podcast, Hale revealed that these pressures caused her to develop an eating disorder.</p><p>"What the f**k these are angels among me. Do I fit into that?" Lucy Hale revealed her insecurities about standing beside the three other girls.</p><p>Standing beside the other stunning women on Pretty Little Liars, <a href=#>Hale had a difficult time not comparing herself to them</a>. She felt a lot of pressure to look as pretty as the rest of them, which caused some tension in her relationships with the cast.</p><p>Hale described being "overwhelmed" with the lifestyle changes that came with being on a popular television series, as well as her attempts to fit in with those around her. Her response to this feeling was to control her eating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"To know that young women were watching this show...

One would assume that this subject would be common ground for the three girls, but Hale clearly did not feel comfortable discussing the pressure she felt with Benson, Mitchell, or Bellisario.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-lucy-hale-didn-39-t-hang-out-with-her-pretty-little-liars-co-stars>Why Lucy Hale Didn't Hang Out With Her Pretty Little Liars Co-Stars</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ashley-benson-lucy-hale-troian-bellisario.jpg><p>Fans expected Pretty Little Liars four main stars to be best friends right off the bat.
