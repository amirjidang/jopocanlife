The property contains three structures. The main villa is star-shaped and known as The Castle. It features 3 bedrooms suites and a thousand square feet of open living space.</p><p>The property also comes with two casitas, offering an ocean view. Each has a bathroom, bedroom, and its own patio. There’s also a tower with two levels with a bedroom and bathroom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only does the home offer a stunning view of the ocean, but it also has its own pool and plenty of space to relax outdoors.</p><p>The home was one of many created by artist and real estate developed Gian Franco Brignone, who enlisted the help of numerous architects to build a series of luxury homes. He intended it to be a hideaway for the rich and famous who appreciated art and bohemian culture.</p><p>Brignone’s goal was to “ <a href=#>create a new form of architecture</a> , with rounded, feminine walls of ‘elephant skin’ stucco, reminiscent of the Mediterranean, but with sky-high, palapa-style roofs.”</p><p>Many celebrities have called the private resort town home, including Tom Ford, Robert De Niro, Mick Jagger and Uma Thurman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kendall and Kylie may not own any properties in Mexico at the moment, but the sisters have several homes to their names.
