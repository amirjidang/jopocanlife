While his full term will not conclude until 2022, new reports suggest the rapper could be getting out on parole as early as 2020.</p><p>The “Hot N***a” artist will reportedly have a parole hearing in Aug. 2020. If all things go according to plan, he could be eligible for&nbsp;an early release&nbsp;by Dec. 2020, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow>TMZ</a>.</p><p>The early parole is based on the prison system’s “time served” rule, according to sources. The 23-year-old reportedly sat in jail awaiting trial from Dec. 2014 until his sentencing in 2016. That being the case, he reportedly racked up a total of 685 days in prison. That tally is equivalent to nearly two years time served, which is why his sentence lessens to 2020 instead of 2022.</p><p>Shmurda is reportedly doing time for conspiracy to commit murder, weapons possession and reckless endangerment. While behind bars, the rapper has received a total of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">11 violations</a> for drug possession, fighting, and carrying a shank. So he’ll have to clean up his act if he would like to stay on track for an early parole.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bobby Shmurda is currently serving time in Upstate New York’s Clinton Correctional Facility.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e8o67YZqqhpaWnsaJ5z5qpqKSVYrWmrdGipaBlYmV%2FcXmUcHBwa2Vk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./blane-crockarell-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-48413-html.html><span>←</span><span>Blane Crockarell Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
