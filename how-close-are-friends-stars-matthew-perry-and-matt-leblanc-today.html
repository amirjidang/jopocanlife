From&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Kudrow being unsure about playing Phoebe</a>&nbsp;to whether <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston still gets paid</a> from the series, there is a lot of juicy information for loyal fans to get excited about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One thing is for sure, Joey and Chandler&nbsp;have an adorable relationship and that was because they each have such a unique personality. Whether taking care of their pet duck or hanging out with the rest of the gang, these guys always seemed to care about each other. That brings up a good question: are Matthew Perry and Matt LeBlanc close in real life?</p><h2 id=a-long-history>A Long History</h2><p>Two of the Friends stars who seem like they would be best friends IRL are Matthew Perry and Matt LeBlanc since, of course, their characters lived together and were totally inseparable. <a href=#>Perry had some personal struggles during season 3</a>, but he remained on the show for all 10 seasons, and it's impossible to imagine the gang without this goofy character.</p><p>It's not known how often Matthew Perry and Matt LeBlanc see each other, but they seem to get along really well, so all signs point to them being fairly close in real life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Joey-Chandler-Friends.jpg><p>The&nbsp;two do speak very fondly of each other, and it sounds like they have a long history together and bonded on the show.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt LeBlanc&nbsp;had kind words</a> about his co-star back in 2016. According to&nbsp;Hello Magazine, he said of Perry, "I saw him yesterday. I love that guy! I can not see him for five years and then get in a room together and still have that shorthand with each other. It's amazing, really. Ten years in a building with no windows and the doors locked, we got to know each other pretty well."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Friends’: Were Phoebe And Joey Supposed To End Up Together?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-cast-is-close>The Cast Is Close</h2><p>LeBlanc considers himself very <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">close with the whole cast</a>. According to&nbsp;Cheat Sheet, he said,&nbsp;“Jen’s like my little sister. Courteney and Lisa are like my big sisters, but Jen’s like my little sister. Matthew’s like my little brother, and David’s like my big brother. That’s how it all broke down. And it’s literally just like chronological.”</p><p>According to&nbsp;People.com, a source talked about how much the actors love each other and how they have been there for each other over the years. They said, “They follow each other’s lives. The fact that they have been there for each other in happy and in sad times says a lot.”</p><p>The source also mentioned a dinner at Courteney Cox's home that the stars attended in October 2019. They explained that it "wasn’t spontaneous and "But they had the most fantastic dinner. There was a lot of laughing and hugs. You would think they see each other all the time."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Did Jimmy Kimmel And Jennifer Aniston Become Best Friends?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=not-friends>Not Friends?</h2><p>There has been some talk that LeBlanc didn't actually like Perry, at least while they were&nbsp;starring on the show. According to&nbsp;The Inquistr, LeBlanc's dad, Paul, said that&nbsp;his son wasn't happy about working with him and while Matt loved Lisa Kudrow, he wasn't a fan of&nbsp;David Schwimmer.</p><p>Despite what LeBlanc's father said, all of the other stories about these two actors are positive.&nbsp;Glamour.com&nbsp;says that the actors hung out at the&nbsp;People's Choice Awards in 2004 and seemed to have a lot of fun together. The publication also says that LeBlanc went to see Perry act in a play in London called&nbsp;The End Of Longing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There definitely doesn't seem to be any bad blood between the two.&nbsp;They had sitcoms on the same night of the week: Perry's&nbsp;The Odd Couple&nbsp;and&nbsp;LeBlanc's&nbsp;Man With A Plan. According to&nbsp;Comedy Central,&nbsp;Variety&nbsp;asked LeBlanc if he would like to act on his former co-star's show, and he said, "Sure. We'll see what happens. My show is set in Pittsburgh, and I think his is in New York. So it's not too far away, right? Just a train ride!" Sure, the show was canceled in 2017 after&nbsp;three seasons, but it was sweet to hear that&nbsp;the actor would have found that fun.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebrities Who Guest Starred On Friends, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>It sounds like the whole cast of&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;really cherishes the time that they filmed the show together and still loves each other to this day. They might not have the chance to hang out every day or even once a month, as they all have busy lives and schedules. But it definitely sounds like Joey and Chandler are pretty close IRL and&nbsp;when the whole cast can get together, everyone appreciates the chance to catch up.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Was Monica Really The Glue That Held The Group Together On ‘Friends’?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmLmwv8RmmKudXZu%2FqrHNnapmq6SWv7R5zJqrraCVrHqxsdGrsGaZnpl6rq3TrWSlnZKhrq%2BvjK2mnZmpZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./arnold-schwarzenegger-terminator-2-judgement-day-salary-15-million-700-words-dialogue.html><span>←</span><span>How Arnold Schwarzenegger Ended Up Making $15 Million For Only 700 Words Of Dialogue In This Movie</span></a>
