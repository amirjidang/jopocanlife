The former costars originally made headlines in November 2022 when they <a href=#>were spotted getting cozy outside of the office</a> on multiple occasions.</p><p>Robach was married to <a href=#><strong>Andrew Shue</strong></a> at the time of the scandal. Holmes, for his part, <a href=#>filed for divorce from his wife</a> of more than a decade, <a href=#><strong>Marilee Fiebig</strong></a>, one month later.</p><p>The duo, who <a href=#>have been spotted together after the scandal</a>, remained tight-lipped while ABC <a href=#>conducted an investigation into their relationship</a>. Us Weekly ultimately broke the news in January 2023 that Robach and Holmes <a href=#>were departing the network</a>. Weeks later, ABC issued a statement about their exit.</p><p>“After several productive conversations with Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes, about different options, we all agreed it’s best for everyone that they move on from ABC News,” the network said at the time. “We recognize their talent and commitment over the years and are thankful for their contributions.”</p><p>Following the professional shakeup, Robach and Holmes have been<a href=#> photographed packing on the PDA several times</a>. A source, meanwhile, exclusively told Us that the couple <a href=#>are looking forward to building a future together</a> on and off the screen.</p><p>“They’ve pitched a reality show, docuseries and daytime talk show, all of which they know will be popular and people will watch. Amy has said whatever they do, this is about real love and they’re in it together,” the insider shared in April.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The source went on to note that whenever “everything has calmed down,” the journalists “have plans to move in together,” noting that “they are serious.”</p><p>Scroll down for everything to know about Pilgrim as she takes over for Robach:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Baw6J5z6KjoKqZonq4tMCtZK2nXaC7sMOMmpmoraRirq7FjKumm5mTncBus8yaamaqlaW5oq%2FEppynrF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./c-to-open-moms-spaghetti-diner-with-store-for-stans-in-detroit.html><span>←</span><span>Eminem To Open 'Moms Spaghetti' Diner With Store For Stans In Detroit</span></a>
