In the realm of<a href=#> inseparable actor/director duos</a>, Martin Scorsese and<a href=#> <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></a> have established a formidable alliance. Similarly, Robert Rodriguez and Danny Trejo’s partnership began quietly, but has since become a hallmark of Rodriguez’s film-making.</p><p>Cillian Murphy is best known for his starring role in the BBC One period drama Peaky Blinders. Long<a href=#> before this commanding performance</a>, however, he was already a force on both stage and screen. His versatile acting prowess was evident as early as the 1990s, when he began his career on stage. Nolan, celebrated for his innovative work in<a href=#> big screen productions like The Prestige and Interstellar</a>, has repeatedly cast Murphy, utilizing his acting skills in films ranging from Inception, to Dunkirk, and The Dark Knight Rises franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cillian-murphy.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Real Reason Christopher Nolan Keeps Casting Cillian Murphy In His Movies">The Real Reason Christopher Nolan Keeps Casting Cillian Murphy In His Movies</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>It was love at first sight when Christopher Nolan first saw a picture Cillian Murphy with his "crazy eyes."</p><p>Together, Murphy and Nolan have forged a cinematic bond that is unique in its consistency and depth.

This was the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sixth collaboration between the pair</a>. And while there is not concrete evidence of a strong personal relationship between them, it is unlikely they would work together so often without getting along.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nolan has openly expressed his admiration for Murphy's dedication to his craft. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, he highlighted the actor’s commitment to challenging himself with new roles. He also commended him for maintaining his authenticity despite his rising fame.</p><p><strong>Nolan stated, “He hasn’t let success change him or get in the way of the truth of this process in any way.”</strong></p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cillian-murphy-got-jacked-for-peaky-blinders-and-emaciated-for-oppenheimer-here-s-the-truth-about-his-yo-yoing-diet-and-workout-routine.jpg></a> <span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Cillian Murphy Got Jacked For Peaky Blinders And Emaciated For Oppenheimer, Here's The Truth About His Strange Diet And Workout Routine">Cillian Murphy Got Jacked For Peaky Blinders And Emaciated For Oppenheimer, Here's The Truth About His Strange Diet And Workout Routine</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Cillian Murphy has changed his body several times thanks to a change in his eating and working out for both Oppenheimer and Peaky Blinders.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other side, Murphy’s admiration for Nolan has always been equally profound. One of the director’s famous films that did not feature him was Interstellar. Speaking about the movie, Murphy said, “It just had a big impact on me. It broke my heart.” His appreciation for Nolan’s work extends beyond their professional relationship, as he enjoys the films from an audience perspective, free from the self-critique that comes with watching his own performances.</p><h2 id=how-did-christopher-nolan-cast-cillian-murphy-in-oppenheimer>How Did Christopher Nolan Cast Cillian Murphy In Oppenheimer?</h2><p>Despite having worked with Christopher Nolan on multiple occasions, Cillian Murphy’s transformation into the titular character in Oppenheimer was the first time he did so in a leading role. This significant casting choice was initiated in an unconventional manner, further emphasizing the unique dynamics of Murphy’s relationship with Nolan. The Peaky Blinders star did not have to audition for the role, as he was the director’s first choice for it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Initial contact for the part, however, did not come directly from Nolan himself. Rather, it was his wife, Emma Thomas, who is also a producer, who reached out to Murphy at his family home in Monkstown, Dublin. The actor recalled the moment vividly, describing Nolan—known for his aversion to modern tech including telephones, emails, and computers—as “the most analogue individual you could possibly encounter.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/what-happened-between-robert-downey-jr-and-cillian-murphy-during-the-filming-of-oppenheimer_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="What Happened Between Robert Downey Jr. And Cillian Murphy During The Filming Of Oppenheimer?">What Happened Between Robert Downey Jr. And Cillian Murphy During The Filming Of Oppenheimer?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Robert Downey Jr. revealed what it was like working with Cillian Murphy, and why he felt "iced out" by his co-star while they filmed Oppenheimer.</p><p>That counted for little, though, when he finally laid his eyes on the script. “I think it’s the best script I ever read,” he told Rolling Stone in a feature titled<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Quiet Passion of Cillian Murphy</a>. Nolan penned the entire screenplay in the first person. “He wanted it to be solely from Oppenheimer’s perspective,” continued Murphy. “And I think the film is sensational. As a person who loves films—I’m not saying it ’cos I’m in the f***ing thing, I hate looking at myself—but as a lover of film, as a cinephile, I’m a Chris Nolan fan.”</p><h2 id=how-cillian-murphy-responded-to-being-cast-in-christopher-nolan-rsquo-s-oppenheimer>How Cillian Murphy Responded To Being Cast In Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/oppenheimer-poster.jpg><p>Speaking with Collider, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cillian Murphy expressed his astonishment at being chosen by Christopher Nolan</a> for the part of the theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, dubbed the “father of the atomic bomb.” The Irishman has consistently communicated, both publicly and directly to Nolan, his eagerness to participate in any project the filmmaker is creating, stating that the size of the role is irrelevant to him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=every-christopher-nolan-film-featuring-cillian-murphy>Every Christopher Nolan Film Featuring Cillian Murphy</h3><table border=3 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Film</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Release Date</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Character</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Role</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Batman Begins</p></td><td><p>June 15, 2005</p></td><td><p>Dr. Jonathan Crane / Scarecrow</p></td><td><p>Supporting</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The Dark Knight</p></td><td><p>July 14, 2008</p></td><td><p>Dr. Jonathan Crane / Scarecrow</p></td><td><p>Supporting</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Inception</p></td><td><p>July 8, 2010</p></td><td><p>Dom Cobb</p></td><td><p>Supporting</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The Dark Knight Rises</p></td><td><p>June 16, 2012</p></td><td><p>Dr. Jonathan Crane / Scarecrow</p></td><td><p>Supporting</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dunkirk</p></td><td><p>July 19, 2017</p></td><td><p>Shivering Soldier</p></td><td><p>Cameo</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Oppenheimer</p></td><td><p>July 13, 2023</p></td><td><p>J.

This longing was finally satiated with his award-winning performance in Oppenheimer, in a production that was described by critics as “one of the best films of the 21st century.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When accepting his Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, Murphy once again paid homage to his boss: “I knew the first time I walked on a Christopher Nolan set that it was different. I could tell by the level of rigor, the level of focus, the level of dedication, the complete lack of any seating options for actors that I was in the hands of the visionary director and master.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigp6uZmbJur8ilo6KZnmK6tr7PobBmmZ6ZeqS00aKqraegnbKzec2oo5qmo2LCr7XQrpxmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chrissy-teigen-kris-jenner-emma-grede-cleaning-brand.html><span>←</span><span>Chrissy Teigen, Kris Jenner &amp;amp; Emma Grede Team Up For Luxury Cleaning Brand</span></a>
