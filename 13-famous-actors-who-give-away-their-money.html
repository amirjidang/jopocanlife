In fact, it might surprise you how many "good guys and gals" there are out there. Many of them are not looking for public approval, so you don't often hear about their generous actions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, there are tax write-offs and other benefits for creating one's own foundation, which most of the actors on this list have done. But the beauty of a foundation is that&nbsp;the founders have control of exactly where the money will be donated.</p><p>Most of these foundations&nbsp;direct the funds toward more than one non-profit organization. Others, like Michael J. Fox's, were&nbsp;created&nbsp;to specifically address one cause. The irony is that there are so many celebrities and non-profit organizations with their hands out, that contributions for each cause tends to be more scant. After all, how many charities can the average American's budget handle? But, we love these&nbsp;celebrities for taking the initiative and giving large donations and time toward the betterment of our world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the more interesting phenomenon that has taken place over the past few years is when celebrities sell exclusive rights to magazines (like People) for milestone ceremonies and events and then turn around and donate the entire payment to charities.&nbsp;In some odd way, it is like having the paparazzi donate to charity.</p><p>Well, suffice it to say, we had a lot of trouble reducing the very long list of generous actors who think nothing of helping others. Obviously, it's impossible to get an accurate tally, particularly from those who donate under the radar.&nbsp;Here is our list of 13 of our favorites with some of their notable&nbsp;donations.</p><h2 id=13-johnny-depp><strong>13. Johnny Depp</strong></h2><p>There are so many facets to <a title="Johnny Depp Net Worth" href=#>Johnny Depp</a>, he is a genuinely unique character - as one could guess by reviewing the variety of roles he has been able to play with perfection. And, he is so very nice that he even surprised one of his young fans by showing up at her school as Captain Jack Sparrow after reading a letter she had written and sent. One story has Depp as having bought&nbsp;500 coats for a&nbsp;film crew when they were on-set and cold. Johnny has a charitable list that is quite long, but some of them are: Fans for Charity, Actors Fund of America Children's Hospice & Palliative Care Coalition, Dogs Deserve Better and several more. The amount of his generosity is undisclosed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=12-jami-gertz><strong>12.

Keanu Reeves</strong></h2><p><a title="Keanu Reeves Net Worth" href=#>Keanu Reeves</a>, best known for his roles in the Matrix series is one of the Hollywood stars who truly doesn't give a hoot about money. For example, just to get The Replacements and The Devil's Advocate produced, Reeves reduced his own paycheck&nbsp;to make room to pay for expensive talent like <a title="Al Pacino Net Worth" href=#>Al Pacino</a> and <a title="Gene Hackman Net Worth" href=#>Gene Hackman</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A couple of years ago his sister was diagnosed with leukemia, so Keanu came to her aid. Not only did he physically put himself in the role of caretaker, he also donated millions to the hospital to help speed up positive results from leukemia research.</p><p>He has also been known to have shared his $80 million Matrix salary with the special-effects team and costume designers as well as paying off personal debts of crew members, buying everyone meals and more. This is a one-of-a-kind, stand-up guy.</p><p></p><h2 id=10-meryl-streep><strong>10.

George Clooney</strong></h2><p>One of the reasons <a title="George Clooney Net Worth" href=#>George Clooney</a> became such a leader in L.A.&nbsp;is because of his ability to gather influential celebrities together to raise awareness and money for high-profile causes.
