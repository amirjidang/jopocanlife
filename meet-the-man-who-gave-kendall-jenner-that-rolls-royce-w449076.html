Sources tell <i>Us Weekly</i> that the 21-year-old model was gifted the luxury vehicle from a millionaire businessman named <b>Saygin Yalcin</b>.</p><p><span>Kendall’s sister</span><b> Khloé Kardashian </b><span>was first to reveal the momager wasn’t behind the generous gift. During an appearance </span><a href=#><span>on</span><i> Jimmy Kimmel Live</i></a><span>&nbsp;on November 4, Khloé joked the car was from “some random prince” who is a family friend through their mom.</span></p><p><span>“We got outside and there’s a Rolls-Royce and this man standing there and I was like, ‘What’s the gift — the guy or the car?’ I was so confused! And then this guy just hands Kendall a pair of keys to this car and I was like, ‘Do we even know who this guy is?’” Khloé recalled to the late-night host. “He was some prince and I was like, ‘Is this a joke?’ On my 21st birthday I got, like, a dinner and a <a href=# data-link=1>purse</a>! I didn’t know you just, like, get cars from strangers.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/517315268_kendall-jenner-zoom-df5fe82c-4269-4dbc-8b23-4e60229e873e.jpg><p>According to an insider, Kris helped Yalcin pull off the big surprise.&nbsp;“Kris played an integral role in orchestrating the gift of the Rolls-Royce from her close family friend, Saygin, to Kendall,” the source tells <i>Us</i>. “She was so excited and happy to be able to make it happen and loved that she was the one who could present Kendall with the keys!”</p><p>Turns out that Yalcin isn’t exactly a prince — but he’s no frog either!</p><p><span>Here are five things to know about the mystery millionaire.</span></p><p><b>1. He’s Best Known for Founding SellAnyCar.com — Among Other Businesses</b></p><p>According to Yalcin’s website’s bio, he’s the founder and CEO of SellAnyCar.com, the Middle East’s first and largest car-buying service. He’s also the “founder of … online private shopping club in the ME, Sukar.com” and a partner at Jabbar Internet & Souq.com Group.</p><p><b>2. He’s a Successful Entrepreneur</b></p><p>Yalcin, who is German of Turkish decent, has been featured in<i> Forbes</i> and first started out founding a successful fashion brand in Europe before starting ventures in Dubai. In a 2015 interview with CNBC, he described himself as a “serial entrepreneur.”</p><p><a href=#>FORBES!!!</a></p><p>A post shared by Saygin Yalcin (@sayginyalcin) on Oct 27, 2016 at 9:53am PDT</p><p><span><b>3. He Does His Homework</b></span></p><p>During an interview with <i>Arabian Business,</i> the 30-something year-old explained his work ethic: “Before going into any business, I’m probably one of the slowest people you could imagine. But when I decide to go into a business, I’m one of the fastest. With SellAnyCar I conducted a lot of research before deciding anything. I did 50 expert interviews with everybody from potential customers, potential sellers and everybody else. I needed to know if it made sense. I did a lot of calculations — it took months to decide whether or not to go into it.”</p><span class=caption></span><p><b>4. He Teaches What He Preaches</b></p><p>According to his corporate bio, Yalcin also serves as an&nbsp;advisory board member and academic lecturer of entrepreneurship&nbsp;at the Canadian University of Dubai. He’s also been selected as a UBS industry leader, which according to his site, is “a network of Ultra-High-Net-Worth individuals.” Yalcin has also seemingly worked with Kendall before. According to his YouTube page, the businessman chatted with the model while speaking at an IdeaLab conference in October 2016.</p><p><b>5. He’s Social Media — and Celeb-Friendly — Savvy</b></p><p>Yalcin — who created a video Instagram story in honor of Kendall’s birthday bash — also has his own YouTube channel that features videos of himself informing others how to build an empire and just him walking around Los Angeles. The highly edited videos also feature his celebrity friends, including selfies with Kendall’s pal <b>Hailey Baldwin</b> and <b>Paris Hilton</b>.&nbsp;</p><p></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><span>His gift-giving moment to the Estée Lauder spokeswoman was also caught in one of his YouTube videos.</span></p><p>“Hi! I was wondering why you’re here,” Jenner can be heard telling him in the video, before she goes in for a hug. Like her sister Khloé, <b>Kourtney Kardashian</b>, however, looked a bit more confused in the footage. “What is happening?” Kourtney can be heard saying.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamnZWperW0xGakmqZdrLWwecaarZ5lm5q7pa3LpWSjnZ6jsrN506GYrWWipLmtv4yrprKblWLEdYCYaW5vZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mandie-taketa-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-125314-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mandie Taketa Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
