This may be where she is in life now, but it hasn't always quite been this way. It's hard to believe, but Eva Longoria originally came from humble beginnings and <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was once referred to as 'the ugly dark one</a>' as a child. Born in a modest family on March 15, 1975, in Corpus Christi, Texas, nobody knew that the little girl who entered the world would one day become one of the most highly esteemed, highest-paid actresses of our time - but she did. Step by step, one brilliant move at a time, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eva Longoria climbed all the way to the top</a>, and<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Hello Magazine</a> quotes her saying, "I think it's funny when people say I'm an overnight sensation because I've been working at it for ten years." Here's a snippet of her journey...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=breaking-out-of-her-shell>Breaking Out Of Her Shell</h2><p>Little Eva was raised on a ranch, and the studious young girl went on to earn a bachelor of science degree in kinesiology. During her spare time, she would regularly participate in school plays, and she clung to her<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> dream of becoming a model</a>. She quickly discovered that she was far too short to be embraced in this industry, but her passion pushed her to keep trying to break into a modeling job. She wound up winning the Corpus Christie beauty pageant, which boosted her ego and gave her confidence to keep trying.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After clinching this win, she was awarded an opportunity to participate in a talent competition in Los Angeles, and she surprised herself by not only doing well but coming out on top. She quickly realized that this was her passion, and she was drawn to a career in acting, so she made the bold decision to remain in California and pursue her new career path.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Things Eva Longoria Does to Achieve Success</a></span></p><h2 id=keeping-up-at-it>Keeping Up At It</h2><p>Before long, Longoria scored a tiny little bit role on the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hit show Beverly Hills 90210,</a> which led to landing another small role on General Hospital. She really excelled when it came to memorizing and delivering her lines, and she was soon offered a position with the cast of The Young and the Restless. She worked hard at pushing the boundaries of her comfort zone and played the role of a mentally unstable character named Isabella. The diversity of this role really set her apart from the rest, and Longoria was awarded an American Latino Media Arts (ALMA) Award for Outstanding Actress in a Daytime Drama.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The acting world was starting to take notice of this rising star, and she had no idea at the time, but the next role that Eva Longoria was about to be offered, was about to change her life.</p><h2 id=longoria-s-breakout-role-on-desperate-housewives>Longoria's Breakout Role On Desperate Housewives</h2><p>In 2004, Eva Longoria was offered a role that would truly change every aspect of her life.</p><p>She tried out for a spot in <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a brand new show called Desperate Housewives</a> and was cast to play the part of Gabrielle Solis. The 5 "2 young actress was about to embark on the journey of her lifetime, and although she was clearly a natural fit to play this character, nobody had any idea that her star would shine so brightly or rise so high.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In no time at all, Desperate Housewives became a huge hit and quickly attracted an international fan base. The sassy, sultry, and incredibly devious Gabrielle Solis stole hearts immediately, and fans were instantly magnetized by the sordid affair that Longoria's character had with the pool boy while her husband was busy at work, earning the money that afforded her the very privileged lifestyle that she led.</p><p>The juicy role she played drew in her fans, and her impeccable delivery made her both believable to the millions of viewers that tuned in religiously, making Desperate Housewives a massive hit. Eva Longoria quickly became a household name, and her path to superstardom was officially paved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the show continued to develop, Longoria's finances also started to reflect her fame. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Biography</a> reports, "by the time Desperate Housewives came to an end in 2012, Longoria was pulling down nearly $400,000 per episode, making her one of the top-paid TV stars in the world."</p><p>She catapulted to enormous fame and managed to score a series of opportunities to act on the big screen, starring in movies such as The Sentinel, with Michael Douglas, Harsh Times with Christian Bale, and The Heartbreak Kid, with Ben Stiller, and many more.</p><h2 id=the-true-colors-of-success>The True Colors Of Success</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The true success of Eva Longoria is not evaluated by her impressive net worth of $80 million or by the memorable roles that she has played for her adoring fans. Rather, it is based on her passion for <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">giving back to those who are less fortunate</a>. Realizing that she had to work hard for over a decade to get to the position she currently has in life and knowing that not everyone gets to see the level of success that she has achieved, Eva Longoria has worked hard to give back to people in greater need. She founded Padres Contra el Cancer, which operates as a nonprofit organization that aids Latino children with cancer and offers support for their families, and that is just one of her humanitarian efforts. Eva Longoria has also founded Eva's Heroes, an organization that offers developmentally challenged youth enhanced support opportunities.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tonight They'll Be Eating: Sir Elton John And Little Nas X Team Up For An Epic Uber Eats Ad</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wealthy Genius</a>,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Hello Magazine,</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Biography</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSurbnOrKtmrZ6Xsq21xK%2BYm6SVYrWmvsSsZKGnp2Kyt62Mpaann5%2BntqJ5z5qtnpxdnbKzedaasGasn2LBqbGMraapZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./agent-00-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Agent 00 Net Worth How Much is Agent 00 Worth?</span></a>
