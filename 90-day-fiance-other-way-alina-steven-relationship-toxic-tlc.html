They appeared on the latest season of 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way <a href=#>alongside fan-favorite couples like Jenny and Sumit</a>. Fans got to meet the young couple when they were getting ready to move to Turkey together. Alina and Steven decided to move to Turkey because the COVID-19 pandemic prevented Steven from moving to Alina's home country, Russia. They wanted to end the distance and get married, so they thought Turkey would be the best place to go until they could move to Russia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'90 Day Fiance': 10 Red Flags In Mike And Natalie's Relationship</a></span></p><p>The couple had some problems while they were long distance and they thought that moving in together would help their relationship. But they still had a lot of problems even after they moved in together. Some fans have even questioned Steven's behavior and wonder why Alina stays with him. <a href=#>Red flags and toxic relationships are nothing new on the 90 Day Fiancé franchise</a>, so let's take a look at all of the reasons why Alina and Steven's relationship might be toxic.</p><h2 id=steven-talked-to-other-women-online><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>Steven Talked To Other Women Online</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first red flag fans noticed in Steven and Alina’s relationship is that Steven didn’t stop talking to other women. Even though he was dating Alina, he still messaged women online. A Reddit user even posted a Snapchat message that Steven sent to someone she knew. The picture shows Steven sticking his tongue out and the caption underneath it says, “Sorry I’m so tired when we text! Been really busy the only time I have is in the early morning when I first wake up.” In a second text he says, “Haha did I tell you I have a really long tongue? but I don’t have a lot of practice with it.” Steven was clearly flirting with her and the message was reportedly sent in September.</p><h2 id=steven-asked-alina-if-he-could-date-other-girls><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>Steven Asked Alina If He Could Date Other Girls</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Along with messaging other girls online, Steven also admitted to asking Alina if he could date other girls. They were officially in a relationship, but Steven saw the long distance as an excuse to date other women. During an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Steven was questioned about it and he said, “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I had just gotten out of a relationship and I didn't feel emotionally ready yet to really dive into a relationship, especially someone as amazing as Alina because I really felt like we had a connection and I really felt like, something was different about her, and I wanted to be ready for that.</a>”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Fans Think ’90 Day Fiance’ Couple Karine And Paul’s Relationship Is Toxic</a></span></p><h2 id=steven-wasn-rsquo-t-clear-about-his-level-of-commitment><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>Steven Wasn’t Clear About His Level Of Commitment</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on what he said in the interview with Entertainment Tonight, Steven was obviously not ready to commit to Alina. After Alina and Steven moved to Turkey together, they had a fight about him going on dates with other girls and kissing them. Alina said she had no idea he was going to do that. During an episode of 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way, Steven told the producers, “I can kind of see why Alina was confused about my level of commitment when we were long distance. Because I’m a big dreamer and I like to talk about the future a lot, about our future. I think she kind of felt like I was Prince Charming coming in on my steed, but my words didn’t really match my level of commitment.” He pretty much lied to Alina about how committed he was to her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alina-asked-her-friend-to-message-steven-to-see-if-he-would-cheat-on-her><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Alina Asked Her Friend To Message Steven To See If He Would Cheat On Her</strong></span></h2><p>Since Steven went out with other girls and broke Alina’s trust, she had to trick him just to see if he was going to be faithful to her going forward. She asked her friend, Masha, to message him and see what he did. But the plan backfired and Masha told Alina that Steven messaged her back. During another episode of 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way, Alina told Steven, "I want to tell you something. I put you on a test with my friend and I asked her to flirt with you. Just to make sure you aren't going to cheat on me. You didn't tell me about her, which means you lied again. I know what you were talking about, I know everything." It’s a huge red flag when you have to trick your boyfriend to know if he’s being faithful to you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=steven-lied-about-being-a-virgin><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Steven Lied About Being A Virgin</strong></span></h2><p>One of the biggest red flags is that Steven also lied to Alina about being a virgin. Steven told Alina he’s a virgin since his religion says they are supposed to wait until marriage to have sex and he wanted her to be able to be baptized. But it turns out Steven already slept with other girls. Steven told Entertainment Tonight, "I don't think 'not honest' is the right terminology here, it's just something that didn't, like, come up necessarily. I'm not sure I knew at the time that that was something she really valued… It's not something I normally talk about in normal conversations. So, Alina, most of the time when we were calling and talking, it didn't hit upon those subjects. Usually when I call and talk with people, I usually don't tell them how many people I've slept with. So, with Alina, that was just something that we never brought up." Alina said they talked about it, so it seems that he lied again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'90 Day Fiancé': All The Details About Yara and Jovi's Las Vegas Wedding</a></span></p><h2 id=alina-made-steven-delete-his-social-media><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Alina Made Steven Delete His Social Media</strong></span></h2><p>After everything that happened, Alina finally had enough of Steven lying and sneaking around, so she asked him to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">delete his social media accounts</a>. She didn’t want him to be able to message other girls online anymore. He agreed to delete them, but he kept putting it off. Steven told the show’s producers, “I’m regretting promising Alina that I’m gonna delete my social media because now she’s constantly on my back about it and I feel that her asking me to delete it is coming from a place of insecurity, rather than a place of wanting our relationship to be in a better place.” This can be considered manipulative, since Steven talks to his friends and family on social media too. However, if he hadn’t lied and talked to other girls, Alina wouldn’tfeel the need to do it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=steven-wasn-rsquo-t-sure-if-he-was-ready-to-get-married-before-he-proposed><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Steven Wasn’t Sure If He Was Ready To Get Married Before He Proposed</strong></span></h2><p>Soon after Steven and Alina moved to Turkey, they were talking about when they were going to get married and Steven admitted he wasn’t sure if he was completely ready yet. That’s definitely a red flag since Steven moved to Turkey to start his life with Alina. But after a few big arguments and almost breaking up, Steven finally decided he was ready and proposed to Alina. Despite all of the red flags in their relationship, the couple still got married. During a teaser for the season 3 finale of 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way, Steven said, "It's been a crazy, crazy journey moving to Turkey to be with her and how much we had to sacrifice for each other. And I think that really speaks to how much we love each other. And that speaks louder than all of the arguments that we've had on the way."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>'90 Day Fiancé': All The Red Flags In Corey And Evelin's Relationship</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhwaWWUlsZussiapZydXaTBqbHRZq6asV2Wuaq6wGaqrZ2mmrtuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZquosJmYerW4wmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-russell-brands-wife-all-about-laura-gallacher.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Russell Brands Wife?
