Amazing, right? What an idea! Except that it’s not new, nor innovative, and she’s rightfully getting dragged.
Per the article, the mother of two “got the idea” for the $100 bonnet while preparing for her wedding."><meta name=author content="Billy Koelling"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
