The 36-year-old gold medalist and her husband, <strong>John Falconetti</strong>, welcomed their second child, daughter <strong>Sterling Diane Falconetti</strong>, on Tuesday, June 25, her rep confirms to <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a>.</p><p>"Shannon and John are thrilled to welcome Sterling into the world," the rep says of the happy family. "Mom and baby are healthy and doing well."</p><p>Sterling, born at 11:49 a.m., joins older brother <strong>Rocco</strong>, 3, whom the couple had in 2009. Fifteen months after their son's birth, Miller was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, which required surgery to remove her left ovary and the cancerous cyst. That was followed by nine weeks of chemotherapy.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Instead of calling my parents to tell them they had another grandchild on the way, I was calling to tell them I may have cancer," she recalled in January 2013 of that time in her life. "Our baby plans were put on hold indefinitely."</p><p>Now cancer free, the Magnificent Seven gymnast — who won gold at the 1996 Atlanta Games — is more grateful than ever for her family and their "miracle baby." "I've been blessed to have the opportunity to do some amazing things in my life," she said in a statement <a href=#>announcing her second pregnancy</a> earlier this year, "but being a mom is second to none."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasoJGju7C6jKagpaSVp3qwuNimp6KbXZzGrrrArKtmr5WhsLC5xKxkm5mSrnqotdGlZKyslae5qrrGZpuimZ6aeri106Fkoa2jl66vsIyjpqGmXZuura%2FOp5ytrJlif3F9kmtsb2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scheana-shay-addresses-hugging-tom-sandoval-in-pump-rules-beach-pics.html><span>←</span><span>Scheana Shay Addresses Hugging Tom Sandoval in 'Pump Rules' Beach Pics</span></a>
