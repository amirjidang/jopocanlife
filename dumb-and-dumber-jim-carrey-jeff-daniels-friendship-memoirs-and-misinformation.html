He later brought his talents to the big screen, starring in popular films like Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, The Mask, and Dumber and Dumber. Fans of the latter film have come to appreciate the chemistry between Carrey and co-star Jeff Daniels both on and off-screen, making it a cult classic since its release in 1994.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>Lauren Holly's Career Took A Dark Turn After Dumb And Dumber</a></span></p><p>Lloyd and Harry, portrayed by Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, are the main characters in the film Dumb and Dumber. In order to return a briefcase that Mary Swanson (played by Lauren Holly) left behind, they travel across the country to Aspen.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> The film was a huge hit, grossing nearly $250 million</a> at the box office.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Roger Ebert even commended Carrey's performance</a> and the chemistry between Carrey and Daniels on screen. In real life, Carrey and Daniels are close friends who have worked together on multiple projects.</p><h2 id=how-jim-carrey-helped-jeff-daniels-get-his-role-in-dumb-and-dumber>How Jim Carrey Helped Jeff Daniels Get His Role In Dumb And Dumber</h2><p>Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels became friends during the filming of Dumber and Dumber, but Jeff was not initially selected to play Harry. It was<a href=#> Jim who convinced the studio executives to cast Jeff</a> in the role, despite their preference for a comedian. Even still,<a href=#> they only paid him $50,000 hoping he would reject it</a> and leave the movie behind. Thankfully he didn't, but it doesn't change the fact that<a href=#> without Jim's intervention, Jeff may never have been part of the iconic comedy.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dumb-and-dumber.jpg><p>According to Variety, Carrey fought for Jeff because he wanted an actor who would listen and react as well as make him listen and react. That wasn't necessary, however, for quite possibly the most memorable scene in the movie. A scene that Jeff Daniels has said actually happened to Clint Eastwood. The toilet scene.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>Fans Didn't Realize Jim Carrey's Daughter Has A Credit In 'Dumb And Dumber To'</a></span></p><p>Lloyd puts liquid laxative into Harry's drink prior to going on a date with Lauren Holly's character. It sounds mean, but Harry stole his girl, he kind of deserved some payback. Long story short, when the laxative kicks in Harry is at his date's house. He struggles to find a bathroom in the mansion and when he finally does it's as if he released the kraken.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not a pretty sight or smell from what we gather. Wouldn't you know it, after all was said and done, the toilet is broken and won't flush. The scene is all in all hysterical, but to think that it actually happened to Clint? Yikes, not so funny then.</p><h2 id=jim-carrey-and-jeff-daniels-39-work-together-after-dumb-and-dumber>Jim Carrey And Jeff Daniels' Work Together After Dumb And Dumber</h2><p>Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels teamed up once again for Dumber and Dumber To. After that, they decided to work on separate films, but it appears that they cannot stay away from each other for long. At a 2018 interview on Conan O'Brian's show, Carrey humorously crashed Daniels' interview and playfully scolded him for not contacting him while he was in town. The chemistry between Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels is undeniable, and it's clear that they have a strong friendship both on and off-screen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jim-and-jeff-mutt-cutts-picture.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of their most recent collaborations occurred in 2020 when Jim Carrey got Jeff Daniels to be the narrator voice for the audio book of Carrey's book, "Memoirs and Misinformation." The book presents an intriguing twist on Hollywood tell-alls, but unfortunately, the novel has been critiques harshly, with some calling it "messy."</p><h2 id=are-jim-carey-and-jeff-daniels-still-close-since-dumb-and-dumber>Are Jim Carey And Jeff Daniels Still Close Since Dumb And Dumber?</h2><p>The on-screen partnership between Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber was so strong that it translated into a real-life friendship that has lasted for years. They have often been seen hanging out together at various events and award shows. Their friendship is a testament to the power of great on-screen chemistry and the lasting impact it can have on people's lives.</p><p>As for what the two of them are doing now, fans of well-known Hollywood actor and comedian Jim Carrey may recall recently when a hoax on social media announced his death. Despite the false news spreading on Twitter and YouTube, it was later confirmed that the actor was not actually deceased.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jeff-daniels-and-jim-carrey.jpg><p>According to reports, the rumor about Jim Carrey's death began after a news outlet ran a headline about his declining health. The article included a link to a video in which the actor reportedly said his final goodbyes to friends and fans.</p><p>Despite the misleading headline, Jim Carrey is alive and well. The article in question was a clickbait website that had no factual basis. Other than that, Jim Carrey did put his home of 30 years up for sale this past February. It's only $28.9 million if you are in the market. Yes, Jim Carrey is doing just fine. Retiring from major acting, but loving every minute of it reports The New York Times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since his breakout role in Dumb and Dumber, Jeff Daniels has continued to build an impressive career, earning critical acclaim for his performances in TV shows like The Newsroom (which won him an Emmy in 2013) and Godless (which earned him another Emmy in 2018), as well as films like The Squid and the Whale, The Purple Rose of Cairo, Pleasantville, and Good Night and Good Luck. Recently, he starred in the political drama miniseries The Comey Rule, and American Rust.</p><p>Up next, Jeff Daniels will take on the main role in the upcoming Netflix drama series A Man in Full, which is based on Tom Wolfe's novel of the same name. The streamer ordered the show directly to series, as previously reported by Variety, with David E. Kelley creating the series and Regina King serving as director and executive producer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The premise of the show is about Charlie Croker, a powerful figure in the Atlanta real estate industry, experiences a sudden financial downfall that puts his entire empire at risk. As he fights to protect his business from opportunistic rivals, he must also contend with the collision of political and business interests. Despite being known for his polarizing and robust personality, Croker is described as crude, rude, and irresponsible. We are excited for anything from Jeff Daniels, and eagerly anticipate the arrival of this new Netflix series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibrqWSYq6vsIydrKaalad6q7XMZpqaqqKaxm62xJ%2BdZpyRo7amuNJmnauhlaOxtLTIqWSmnZ2ktrO%2FjJqlnWWdnsCqusWoqaaZpJ68r3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-wells-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>David Wells Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
