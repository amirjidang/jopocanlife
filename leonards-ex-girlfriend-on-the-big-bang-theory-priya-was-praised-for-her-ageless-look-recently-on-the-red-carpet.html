In fact, Mann wasn't only set to be on the show for one or two episodes at the start, but things took a turn after Kaley Cuoco was injured off camera.</p><p>We'll reveal what went on with Mann on the sitcom, while also taking a look at a recent video that had fans talking, showing Aarti Mann on the red carpet of Netflix's, The Recruit.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Kaley Cuoco And Johnny Galecki Completely Broke Down In Tears Addressing The Big Bang Theory Audience For One Final Time</a></span></p><h2 id=aarti-mann-39-s-run-on-the-big-bang-theory-was-only-meant-to-be-short-term>Aarti Mann's Run On The Big Bang Theory Was Only Meant To Be Short-Term</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar45355936.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the start, <a href=#>Aarti Mann's run on The Big Bang Theory was supposed to look very different</a>. However, plans changed after Kaley Cuoco broke her leg off-set during a horse riding accident. Suddenly, Mann had more time on the show, though she never really knew how long it was going to last.</p><p>She tells the Post-Gazzette, "The character changed completely. Originally she was engaged and she was going to get married and Leonard was her last fling. We rehearsed it over the week and it became just Priya making a booty call," she said. "It was revealed to me after we shot the show that [executive producer] Bill [Prady] wanted to leave the option open for Priya to come back later in the season."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Filming Certain Scenes On The Big Bang Theory Turned Into A Complete Nightmare For Mayim Bialik (But Nobody Knew Why)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mann had a blast on the show, but wasn't sure as to what the path forward was. "I spent this whole arc not really knowing how long I was going to be on or where it was going, which is great because it forces you to play the material as opposed to playing the overriding arc of the character," she said.</p><p>Mann was open to a return down the road and the writers had also left things completely open. However, for the sake of Leonard and Penny's relationship, Priya was kept off the show.</p><h2 id=aarti-mann-turned-heads-during-her-appearance-at-the-recruit-premiere>Aarti Mann Turned Heads During Her Appearance At The Recruit Premiere</h2><p>Mann's time on The Big Bang Theory came up after 12 episodes on the show. Her final episode took place in 2011. At that point, Mann wanted to head back to commercial work. However, she ended up taking on several significant roles including Suits, Scandal, NCIS: New Orleans, Grey's Anatomy, The Good Doctor and most recently, eight episodes of The Recruit.</p><p>Aarti Mann also took part in the red carpet premiere, and she was turning lots of heads. The video was posted by Maximo TV on YouTube.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Kaley Cuoco Blamed Johnny Galecki For Leaving Her Out When The Big Bang Theory Started Filming</a></span></p><p>Clearly, Mann is still doing very well for herself, appearing on a major Netflix show. Without a doubt, her role on The Big Bang Theory was a major confidence boost and one that put her on the map.</p><h2 id=aarti-mann-left-a-positive-impression-on-her-co-stars-particularly-johnny-galecki-during-the-big-bang-theory>Aarti Mann Left A Positive Impression On Her Co-Stars, Particularly Johnny Galecki During The Big Bang Theory</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/your-paragraph-text-2023-09-24t085326-552.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taking on the comedy genre was a completely different career path for Mann during her time on The Big Bang Theory. In fact, the actress was constantly reminded by Chuck Lorre to play the role simple, and not try to be funny about it.</p><p>"Whenever we're rehearsing I'll try to play it in a more comedic way and [executive producer] Chuck [Lorre] always comes in and says, 'Play it simply. You're beautiful when you're simple.' I'm constantly told to reel it back in. I think I'm giving them what they need for the show. Every sitcom needs their straight man or straight woman."</p><p>Despite her discomfort, Mann made a great impression on her fellow co-stars. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnny Galecki revealed that she fit in right from the start</a>, the cast took to Mann as one of their own.</p><p>Galecki tells TV Line, "I thought it made a whole lotta sense. She did one episode this season, and we just really loved Aarti [Mann], and her work ethic kind of melded with everybody else’s. And it makes sense as far as the characters. She is Leonard’s sort of intellectual equivalent, so they’re able to communicate more effortlessly than Leonard and Penny (Kaley Cuoco), certainly."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Priya didn't get a formal goodbye on the show, it is mentioned by Raj during the later seasons that she ended up getting married. At the very least, Priya got the conclusion to her character that she deserved, even if some fans weren't too enthusiastic about her involvement getting in the way of Leonard and Penny's love for one another.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijnqeelr%2Blv4yer2afmae5p77InqWdZZ%2BjerW0xGaZop9dl66vs4ytn56noq56sb7Isphmr5GoerG%2BwKKqnpxdm7yzeceeqWaZl5q5pr%2FSZqOop5tiv6avxKerpbFdpLtuwMeeZKudlGKwor7Pnqto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kevin-plawecki-wife-tayler-francel-salary-net-worth-girlfriend-bio.html><span>←</span><span>Kevin Plawecki Wife Tayler Francel Salary, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Bio</span></a>
