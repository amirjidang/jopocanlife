During<a href=#> her debut year at SUR</a>, Lee — who was <a href=#>the show’s first transgender cast member</a> — quickly hit it off with the TomTom founder and then-girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a>. The comedian even went on an on-camera date with Ariana’s brother, <a href=#><strong>Jeremy Madix</strong></a>.</p><p class=p1>“I love Ariana, so it just really kind of scared me and I did get a little nervous before my date [with her brother],” Lee e<a href=#>xclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in March 2018</a>. “But at the same time, I talked to <a href=#><strong>Scheana [Shay]</strong> </a>and she’s like, ‘You know who he is; he’s an amazing person. Don’t let [<a href=#><strong>Stassi Schroeder</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Katie Maloney</strong></a>’s] negative perception of him affect you and this date tonight.’ <a href=#><strong>Lala&nbsp;[Kent]</strong></a> and&nbsp;Scheana really helped me that day, just putting me back into a positive situation because sometimes I think Stassi and them can be a little bit on the negative side.”</p><p class=p1>The reality TV alum further gushed to&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>that her date with Ariana’s brother was “amazing” and they still “kick it all the time.” She added at the time: “I’ve said this from the start, I <a href=#>didn’t wanna get into a serious relationship</a>. And I’m a little older than him and I know he has some things to experience, so I didn’t wanna jump into anything serious with him, but I do enjoy him.”</p><p class=p1>Lee <a href=#>ultimately left&nbsp;<i>Vanderpump Rules&nbsp;</i>after season 7</a> over claims that she had been bullied during her reality TV stint. Despite walking away from the show, she remained close with both Sandoval and Ariana.</p><p class=p1>However, things reached a turning point in March 2023 after<a href=#> news broke of Sandoval and the Lifetime actress’ breakup</a>. (Their split came shortly after it was revealed that the Missouri native had <a href=#>a months-long secret affair</a> with costar <a href=#><strong>Raquel Leviss</strong></a>.) Lee, for her part, wanted to be there for both friends — <a href=#>much to her former costars’ dismay</a>.</p><p class=p1>“Tom and Ariana are my family. They <a href=#>have been there for me over the years</a> and I wouldn’t be where I am today without them. It saddens me that people are so fixated on picking a side. Both are human and are both hurting in their own ways,” she wrote via Instagram in April 2023. “There is a world where you can support and be there for both parties and that’s the world I choose to live in.”</p><p class=p1>Lee added at the time: “There is also no reason for this to continue to be so divisive.&nbsp;Ariana is happy&nbsp;and Tom is really working hard on himself. I’ll continue to love and support them unconditionally.”</p><p class=p1>That month, Lee was<a href=#>&nbsp;spotted hanging out with Sandoval</a> one-on-one as<a href=#> Ariana unfollowed her on Instagram</a>. Shay — as <a href=#>a show of solidarity</a> for the Florida native — also tapped the unfollow button on Lee’s profile.&nbsp;The “Good as Gold” songstress even told<a href=#><strong> Andy Cohen</strong> </a>during an April 2023 appearance on&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen</a>&nbsp;</i>that<a href=#> she thought Lee was “shady”</a> for her hangouts with Sandoval.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In the season 10 finale, which aired in May 2023, Kent <a href=#>accused Sandoval of cheating with Lee</a> years before his affair with Leviss. “We need to open that case back up. It went cold and I don’t think it needs to be cold no more,” she said.</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to revisit Sandoval and Lee’s friendship timeline:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BpvK550pqlnaemlrlursilo6KdXaGypr%2BMn6minZ6ZwKm1z2aroqWVobavsYytn6unpZy1bsDHnmSynZGnwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dwayne-the-rock-johnson-movies-over-400-million-at-box-office-net-worth-increase.html><span>←</span><span>These Dwayne Johnson Movies Grossed Over $400 Million At The Box Office Causing His Net Worth To Exp</span></a>
