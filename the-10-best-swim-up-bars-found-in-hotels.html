A huge part of enjoying the sun is also enjoying the water. Whether it's on the beach, at a lake or by a pool, there really is nothing better than lounging&nbsp;by the water, feeling the sun on your skin and sipping on a pina colada. But what happens to that pina colada&nbsp;when you get too warm and need to go into the pool? When your companions are waving you over joyously, and you just can't say no? Why, it gets left there, of course and it melts away under the hot sun, becoming less refreshing by the moment!&nbsp;But no fear! There is a solution! The pool bar!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A pool bar allows for you to cool off in the water, with none of the cocktail abandonment! Different from the run-of-the mill pool&nbsp;<i>side&nbsp;</i>bars, a swim up pool bar is actually accessible from the pool itself so all you have to do is paddle your way over to the bar and take a seat! No longer burdened with the need to choose between their drinks and their pool, the swim up pool bar literally allows swimmers to have their cake and eat it too! (Or in this case, their drinks!)</p><h2 id=10-centara-grand-beach-resort-amp-villas-hua-hin-thailand-200-per-night><b>10. Centara Grand Beach Resort & Villas, Hua Hin, Thailand: $200 Per Night</b></h2><p>The rooms at the Centara Grand Beach Resort & Villas come with jacuzzis and/or their very own pools, with views of the pool area or sea.

Don’t forget their poolside bar, where you can take a “dip and sip”. The bar, that is equally as decked out with palm trees as the rest of the beautiful pool, is sure to keep you smiling!</p><p></p><h2 id=9-hotel-kivotos-mykonos-greece-275-per-night><b>9. Hotel Kivotos, Mykonos, Greece: $<b>275 Per Night</b></b></h2><p>There's nothing worse than a bar closing early, because it's the later hours of the night when you really want to get your drink on! Well, no worries if you're staying at the Del Mar! The tropical Del Mar Bar swim-up bar is open until midnight, which means that you can lounge in the water long after the sun goes down enjoying whatever beverage takes your fancy. With good music, friendly bar staff and marvelous cocktails, you'll be relaxing in the sun (and moon) in no time!</p><p></p><h2 id=8-omni-cancun-hotel-amp-villas-cancun-300-per-night><b>8.
