For those who are long-time fans of the hip hop artist, you might have a few more songs floating around up there, but one thing is for sure: This guy has never had an unsuccessful song. While there are some that are loved a little less, there are many that are well-loved (and then some). His albums are played on repeat, remixed at clubs, played on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">throwback</a> playlists, and, quite frankly, we're never going to give him up... That was Rick Astley, but you know what we mean!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So how did this artist make all of his millions? Aside from his obvious charm and serious talent with vocals and lyrics, he has a few other tricks up his sleeve. His talents aren't limited to singing and he's definitely known for more than a few club songs. In fact, he's still putting out music to this day and has over 17,000,000 million listeners on Spotify each month alone. Here's what we know about Usher and his money-making methods.</p><h2 id=he-was-15-years-old-when-he-released-his-first-self-titled-album><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>He Was 15 Years Old When He Released His First Self-Titled Album</span></h2><p>A star is a star, but Usher was a rising star. He began a lifestyle of music at a young age and was only a teenager when he released his first album. As a young boy of only 15, he found fame through&nbsp;LaFace Records, scoring a record deal with them in 1994.</p><h2 id=a-billboard-hot-100-no-1-single-brought-him-fame-with-his-97-album><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>A&nbsp;Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 Single Brought Him Fame With His '97 Album</span></h2><p>Only three years later, Usher learned what it was like to be one of the hottest R&B stars in the country. He made it to the Billboard Hot 100 and from that point on, there was no looking back. While many artists mellow out and experience a dropoff with their music, Usher hasn't yet seen a significant drop in popularity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=in-2001-he-was-praised-for-the-singles-we-all-know-and-love><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>In 2001, He Was Praised For The Singles We All Know And Love</span></h2><p>While he was super on his game in the 90s, the early 2000s brought about even more fame and recognition. Music was undergoing a significant change and teens were all about club music and songs that spoke of real-life things: True love, breakups, hitting up the club, burning up the dancefloor, and the list goes on.</p><h2 id=his-grammys-only-pushed-his-success-even-further><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>His Grammys Only Pushed His Success Even Further</span></h2><p>He's the proud owner of two Grammys from the People's Choice Awards, having seen them after his successes from 'You Make Me Wanna' in 1997 all the way up to 'U Got It Bad' and 'U Remind Me' in the early 2000s. His songs are timeless and his style even more so.</p><h2 id=the-singer-is-also-an-actor-many-might-know-him-from-chicago-on-broadway><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>The Singer Is Also An Actor, Many Might Know Him From&nbsp; Chicago&nbsp;On Broadway</span></h2><p>The hip hop artist took a bit of a break from the music scene to devote his talents elsewhere, and some might recognize his name on the playbill for&nbsp;Chicago. As it turns out, not only is Usher beyond talented when it comes to singing and songwriting, but he's also got a pretty fun knack for acting, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=endorsement-is-the-name-of-the-game-usher-debit-mastercard><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Endorsement Is The Name Of The Game: Usher Debit Mastercard</span></h2><p>Doesn't it seem like almost every major celeb has endorsed some credit card or another? While Chipotle hands out celeb cards nowadays, back in the day, Usher had his own debit card named after him. Fans of both Usher and credit cards alike had the option to apply for an Usher Raymond IV Debit MasterCard.</p><h2 id=he-also-raises-money-by-partnering-with-yoobi><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Also Raises Money By Partnering With Yoobi</span></h2><p>While this money doesn't go directly to him, it's a cause that he works adamantly for. This isn't the only cause he supports, however - Usher has his own foundation, called the New Look Foundation, formed in 1999. He also works with the Boys & Girls Club of America, the NAACP, and the Trumpet Foundation.</p><h2 id=his-reputation-precedes-him-as-one-of-the-best-r-amp-b-singers-of-the-21st-century><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>His Reputation Precedes Him As One Of The Best R&B Singers Of The 21st Century</span></h2><p>As if his music career wasn't already a vast record of that. To confirm it, Usher has been referred to as one of the greatest R&B artists of the 21st century and will likely always been known as one of our generation's greatest artists, period. There was nothing like walking into the club on a teen night and hearing 'U Make Me Wanna'.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=confessions-sold-over-1-1-million-copies-around-the-world-during-week-one><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>'Confessions'&nbsp;Sold Over 1.1 Million Copies Around The World During Week One</span></h2><p>It's not surprising, considering how popular this album&nbsp;still&nbsp;is to this day. During a time when R&B was at its peak,&nbsp;Confessions&nbsp;came to us in a time of need. It was the CD that was in everyone's walkman, the one we had on repeat in our bedroom stereos, and held the songs that we all blasted in the car.</p><h2 id=it-was-also-the-best-selling-album-of-the-2000s><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>It Was Also The Best-Selling Album Of The 2000s</span></h2><p>Whoa whoa whoa - hold on here. Not only did&nbsp;Confessions&nbsp;mark a wild ride of a sellout period, but it was also hailed as one of the greatest of the decade? Just kidding, this isn't surprising. Those with a serious Usher love live to confirm that yes, this album was just that good.</p><h2 id=the-most-recent-album-daddy-s-home-was-met-with-just-as-much-success><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Most Recent Album, 'Daddy's Home', Was Met With Just As Much Success</span></h2><p>Even if it wasn't that great, would anyone have complained? While other musicians have fallen victim to harsh criticisms and critiques on music that takes them in a new direction, Usher has stuck to his roots. Delivering hit after hit, fans know they're in good hands when it comes to this artist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Timeline Of Hip-Hop's 18 Most Notorious Beefs</a></span></p><h2 id=the-singer-has-seen-nothing-but-success-with-his-music-consistently-increasing-revenue><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Singer Has Seen Nothing But Success With His Music, Consistently Increasing Revenue</span></h2><p>Obviously, all this money doesn't get made in one shot and then it's done with. Over the decades, Usher has continuously collected revenue from his music, including all those listens on Spotify and YouTube. The more his music is listened to, the more money that's generated, as with anything else.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Pics Showing How Jay-Z Became The First Billionaire In Hip-Hop</a></span></p><h2 id=he-has-appeared-in-songs-with-other-artists><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He Has Appeared In Songs With Other Artists</span></h2><p>Everyone wants a piece of this success... Just kidding. It's definitely not uncommon for R&B artists to collab with one another and that's exactly what Usher did in the 2000s. Back then, there would be so many artists listed on one track that we'd have to abbreviate them all to fit in one Motorola Razr text message.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=yeah-hit-the-top-of-the-charts-and-didn-t-come-back-down-for-12-weeks><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>'Yeah!' Hit The Top Of The Charts And Didn't Come Back Down For 12 Weeks</span></h2><p>It's still stuck in your head to this day, isn't it? We'd be willing to bet that it is and for good reason: This song was played&nbsp;everywhere. On the radio (repeatedly, ten times a day), in clubs, in bars, in the grocery store when you were scoping around for Dunkaroos to satisfy your sugar craving... Everywhere.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Stunning Photos Of Celebs And Their Rolls-Royces</a></span></p><h2 id=his-music-has-also-been-used-in-popular-films><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>His Music Has Also Been Used In Popular Films</span></h2><p>Lastly, there's a fee for playing music in movies, too. Many artists are lucky enough to have their songs featured in popular films and Usher's music is no exception. His songs have been heard on more than one track, and every time we hear them, we're transported back to the first time we heard it... And he's adding to his bank account, rightfully so.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's How Patrick Dempsey Amassed His Reported $60 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHqpu9ZmrKyglad6ornArKqenF2dtrR50Z6nqKqkmrFufo9pZKahnKG2sLqMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./harlow-darby-missing.html><span>←</span><span>Harlow Darby Missing: A Frantic Search Ends</span></a>
