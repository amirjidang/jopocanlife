He is a hairstylist by profession.</p><p>While his mother, Rose Maniscalco, was a secretary, she comes from a family of Sicilian, Campanian, and Naples roots. Maniscalco credits his mom for his book becoming a bestseller.</p><p>As reported by&nbsp;The Brag, the comedian revealed that his parents divorced in 2011 in their 60s since the news was critical. Also, Sebastian could not share it with anyone, as it would have significantly impacted him and his sister.</p><p>Growing up under the shadow of his supportive parents, Sebastian learned the importance of family. The comedian is the father of a beautiful daughter, Serafina Simone (Cellie Rose),&nbsp;born in May 2017, and a son, Caruso Jack, born in June 2019.</p><p>Sebastian often shares cute moments with his children on his Instagram account. Moments like these are made to last a lifetime.</p><p>In a&nbsp;video,&nbsp;he can be seen dancing with her dad, bringing you major heart-eye emojis. Plus, her jumps at the end of the video are too cute for words.</p><p>Sebastian posted a&nbsp;gush-worthy video&nbsp;of himself and his son Caruso, who are spitting images of each other. Caruso looks so comfy and bundled up in his winter gear. His cheeks are too precious.</p><p>Maniscalco shares his kids with his dear wife, Lana Gomez. Interestingly, his wife Lana is a renowned American painter, Lana Gomez, whom he married on August 24, 2013.</p><p>Her official website shows her art pieces are featured everywhere, from the legendary Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills to outdoor venues, office buildings, and private residences.</p><p>Lana’s work has also been featured in trend-setting publications such as House Beautiful, InStyle, Lonny, Los Angeles Confidential, and The New Yorker.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sebastian-maniscalco-has-a-sister-who-he-loves-vey-dearly></span>Sebastian Maniscalco Has A Sister Who He Loves Vey Dearly<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If there’s one thing Sebastian is passionate about, it’s family. Talking about his siblings, he has a sister in his family named Jessica Maniscalco Dadon. She was born in Arlington Heights, Illinois, also known as Chicagoland.</p><p>She is much like her brother and uses humor to get through hard times, such as when her grandfather was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. It’s one of the ways she and her family manage to stay close.</p><p>In an interview with CBS News, Jessica admitted to taking part in family jokes, including ones about her father’s “man cave domain.” She said that he has a man cave “in their house!” It’s jokes like these that run through the family and give Sebastian ideas for his stand-up.</p><p>Though Jessica is a married woman and stays away from her brother and family, she shares a strong sister bond with Sebastian. Sebastian is also often seen sharing photos and videos with his sister and other family members and enjoying the moment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJuforKltcCnZJqmlGKupMDOq2SsnZKWwLW1wKdkppmensCkrcucpmaemaOurbjYZquapJuoeqKuzq6rZqCZqHqxrdGepa2rXZa7pXnToZyiql2Ztre70ZycZqeeYsC1rcaeZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrity-wives-girlfriends-of-mlb-players-kate-upton-more.html><span>←</span><span>Celebrity Wives, Girlfriends of MLB Players: Kate Upton, More</span></a>
