Despite that, the fact remains that many observers are more fascinated by Kim Kardashian's love life.</p><p>That makes perfect sense since Kardashian's love life is interesting in many ways, including <a href=#>how her divorce from Kanye "Ye" West affected her net worth</a>. On top of that, many fans are interested in her marriage to and divorce from Kris Humphries. For example, fans want to know <a href=#>how Kardashian's siblings felt about Humphries</a> and why she divorced him so quickly.</p><p>This article will take a look back at <strong>why Kardashian married Humphries</strong> in the first place. After that, the article will reveal why Kardashian says <strong>reality TV was to blame for her failed marriage</strong> to Humphries.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-kardashian-revealed-the-sad-truth-about-why-she-married-kris-humphries>Kim Kardashian Revealed The Sad Truth About Why She Married Kris Humphries</h2><p>Since Kim Kardashian is a reality TV star, she has been forced to publicly answer for a lot of things that most people keep private. One example of that is the fact that Kardashian has repeatedly been asked to <strong>explain her quick and failed marriage to Kris Humphries</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ttweb_kim-kardashian-s-siblings-had-a-complicated-relationship-with-her-ex-husband-kris-humphries_bk_a1_v2.jpg><p>While talking to Alan Carr, Kardashian revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her idealistic belief in love is what resulted in her disastrous marriage</a> to Humphries. Kardashian also cited the pressure of comparing her life to what was going on with the people around her.</p><p>"You know, I think that I'm the kind of girl, like, I'm such a hopeless romantic, and all my friends around, are married with babies. I just, I really want that. That's what, to me, like, success is, is having a family and, you know, a partner. And when I met him, I thought that's what I saw in him."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kardashian then went on to say that <strong>rushing into their marriage</strong> played a major role in her failed relationship with Humphries.</p><p>"And, you know, we never lived together before we got married. So, I think it was, just how it all happened so fast. I kind of, you know, I did fall in love, but I think I got caught up and, and everything that was going on around it."</p><p>Kardashian then went on to describe how she quickly came to realize that<strong> marrying Humphries was a mistake</strong>.</p><p>"And, once we did move in together, I realized fast that this wasn't for me. Doesn't mean that he's not a great person and I don't love him. It's just not, it just wasn't for me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/kim-kardashian-and-kris-humphries-before-their-divorce.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a vulnerable moment, Kardashian also explained what the <strong>motivation behind filing to divorce Humphries so quickly</strong> was.</p><p>"So I figured that it was easier to get out and quicker, and it would, in the, in the long run save a lot of people's hearts. And it's so embarrassing, obviously, having this huge wedding on TV and doing that. Like, most people would have stayed."</p><p>At that point in the conversation, Carr asked Kardashian to clarify that <strong>she didn't marry Humphries for publicity</strong>. Not only did Kardashian state that wasn't the case, she talked about how hurtful it was that anyone thought she would do that.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/does-caitlyn-jenner-get-along-with-her-children-today-or-are-they-still-not-talking-after-years-of-conflict_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Is Caitlyn Jenner Devastated By Her Relationships With Her Children?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Caitlyn Jenner's once close relationship with her famous daughters has gone through some very hard times amidst feuds and anger.</span><p>E! clearly didn't think that Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries getting married was a mistake for the network. According to Deadline, the two-night special Kim’s Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">set a ratings record for the network as it drew 10.5 million viewers</a> .</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before Kardashian opened up to Carr about her marriage to Humphries, it initially seems like she was going to shut down. As soon as her marriage to Humphries came up, Kardashian's smile disappeared, and she sounded quieter as she responded.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kim-kardashian-pic.jpg><p>"It depends on what you're going to ask me."</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What is the timeline of Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries' relationship</a>, according to US Weekly?</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Begin dating (October 2010)</strong></li><li><strong>Kris Humphries proposes (May 2011)</strong></li><li><strong>Their wedding day (August 2011)</strong></li><li><strong>Renewed their vows (October 2011)</strong></li><li><strong>Kim Kardashian files for divorce after 72 days (October 2011)</strong></li><li><strong>Kris Humphries files to annul the marriage (November 2011)</strong></li><li><strong>Divorce finalized (April 2013)</strong></li></ul><p>To Carr's credit, he managed to bring Kardashian out of her shell after she seemed less engaged. Carr did this by cracking an undeniably funny joke about the length of Kardashian and Humphries' marriage.</p><p>"You got married at the end of the last series, but you split up after 72 days. I mean, I've got things in my fridge that lasted longer."</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-later-blamed-reality-tv-for-her-failed-marriage-to-kris-humphries>Kim Kardashian Later Blamed Reality TV For Her Failed Marriage To Kris Humphries</h2><p>When Kim Kardashian was still married to Kanye "Ye" West in 2021, Andy Cohen interviewed her and her family.
