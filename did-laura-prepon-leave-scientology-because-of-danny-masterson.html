However, according to Tony Ortega, Prepon might've left Scientology as a way to prevent further damage from taking place, given what was going on with Masterson and his serious charges.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>That '70s Show Star Lisa Robin Kelly Was Planning To Make A Comeback Just Prior To Her Passing</a></span></p><p>It was Masterson that had brought Prepon into Scientology in the first place. However, it seems as though Prepon's team wanted her out, and she might've played a role in speaking to one of Masterson's victim. Again this isn't confirmed and <a href=#>a rumor that dates back to 2020 from Tony Ortega.</a></p><p>Ortega writes, "While Prepon’s Hollywood handlers are doing damage control, however, we wanted to remind readers something we first pointed out three years ago, and that was the part Prepon played in Scientology’s attempt to silence one of Masterson’s victims."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is said that Prepon tried speaking to one of the victims, asking her if she was upset with Masterson. It was an apparent attempt to save her fellow actor, while getting the victim out of Scientology.</p><p>Prepon has openly discussed her decision to leave Scientology and according to the That '70s Show star, the departure has nothing to do with Masterson.</p><h2 id=laura-prepon-claims-she-left-scientology-after-her-mindset-shifted-thanks-to-motherhood>Laura Prepon Claims She Left Scientology After Her Mindset Shifted Thanks To Motherhood</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar50056090.jpg><p>Laura Prepon did admit she left Scientology, however, there are no controversial circumstances attached to her departure. Prepon claims she left the group because of changing beliefs. <a href=#>Motherhood especially changed things for Prepon.</a></p><p>"I'm no longer practicing Scientology," says Prepon. "I've always been very open-minded, even since I was a child. I was raised Catholic and Jewish. I've prayed in churches, meditated in temples. I've studied Chinese meridian theory. I haven't practiced Scientology in close to five years and it's no longer part of my life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"If motherhood has taught me anything so far, it's that something can work out for a period of time and then you move on and evolve from that."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Mila Kunis Nervously Visited Debra Jo Rupp's Dressing Room On That '70s Show Before Her First Kiss With Ashton Kutcher</a></span></p><p>Prepon would also admit that she gravitated towards meditation instead, finding it a very calming practice. She didn't dedicate herself to any other religion and is instead open to all beliefs.</p><p>Although she wanted to leave things off on a positive note, another sitcom star wasn't impressed with her departure from the church of Scientology.</p><h2 id=leah-remini-doesn-39-t-respect-the-way-laura-prepon-left-scientology>Leah Remini Doesn't Respect The Way Laura Prepon left Scientology</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/instar49104654.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Leah Remini has been very vocal when it comes to her experience with Scientology. However, <a href=#>she wasn't as impressed with Laura Prepon's departure</a>, especially given the fact that the actress decided to remain quiet about her time with the church.</p><p>Remini was disappointed by this.</p><p>“I think people have a responsibility to do their part,” said Remini, a former Scientologist herself. “Not everybody feels that they have a responsibility. They feel they should just go on with their lives, while some of us take a beating.”</p><p>She added, “Some people, like Laura, feel that they don’t have a responsibility to speak out. Do I respect it? I mean, not really.”</p><p>Remini would also reveal that it was there responsibility as former members to educate others on the mistakes they made. Prepon refused to comment on the matter, and it doesn't appear as though she'll address Remini's comments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoa62vsBmp6udoKS7brjEmq2eZaOYtqa606ijqJ%2BpYq%2Bmr8Cuqp5ln5t6pa3Np7BmpZGowaa%2B0qilaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-halloween-star-jamie-lee-curtis-really-have-her-legs-insured.html><span>←</span><span>Did Halloween Star Jamie Lee Curtis Really Have Her Legs Insured?</span></a>
