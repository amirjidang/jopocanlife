Sure, safer offerings like <a href=#>Friends</a> can do well, but at the same time, shows like <a href=#>Charmed</a> can become hits, so long as they bring their A-game each episode.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During its time on television, <a href=#>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a> was a huge hit, and the cast was brilliant in each episode. These performers made bank on the show, and many fans have grown curious about which star has the highest net worth.</p><p>So, which Buffy star tops the net worth list? Let's take a look and see.</p><h2 id=39-buffy-39-was-a-successful-show>'Buffy' Was A Successful Show</h2><p>Back in 1997, Buffy the Vampire Slayer made its debut on the small screen, and it looked to take what the movie did and ramp things up to another level. Instead of bringing Kristy Swanson back, Joss Whedon mixed things up in what proved to be a stroke of genius.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar as the titular character, Buffy the Vampire Slayer was an incredible offering on the small screen for those looking for a legitimately good show. This series knew exactly what it was and didn't try or need to be anything else. Because of this, the show was also to thrive for 7 seasons and over 140 episodes.</p><p>When speaking about the show and what it accomplished, Gellar said, "I think, as an actor, you always want to create something that holds up, that stands the test of time, that makes an impact...We did that with 'Buffy.'"</p><p>Needless to say, the primary performers who appeared on Buffy the VampireSlayer were able to make some serious cash on the show. As far as ranking their net worth goes, there is some stiff competition at the top.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here’s What Charisma Carpenter Has Been Up To Since ‘Buffy' And 'Angel'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sarah-michelle-gellar-is-worth-30-million>Sarah Michelle Gellar Is Worth $30 Million</h2><p>Coming in at the number two spot is Buffy herself, Sarah Michelle Gellar, who is worth a reported $30 million. Gellar's career is an underrated one, as she was part of more successful projects than some people might even realize. Buffy, however, is her biggest project to date.</p><p>Instead of trying to distance herself from her biggest role, Gellar has accepted the fact that she played an iconic character on the small screen.</p><p>"If you'd asked me a year after the show, I would've had that 20-year-old, snobby, 'I'm known for more than that' [attitude] or whatever. But now, I realize as a real adult that because the show is so successful because I am so proud of the indelible mark that we made with that show and that character it gives me the freedom to try other things," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Outside of her impressive time on Buffy, Gellar was also featured in projects like I Know What You Did Last Summer, Scream 2, Scooby-Doo, TMNT, and Star Wars Rebels. Interestingly, her husband, Freddie Prinze Jr., was a lead voice actor on Rebels, and it was cool for fans to learn that they were working together again.</p><p>Gellar has had a fantastic career and has the net worth to prove it, but her $30 million comes up short in this contest of net worths.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Sarah Michelle Gellar Choose A 'Big Bang Theory' Cameo Over A 'Buffy' Reboot?</a></span></p><h2 id=alyson-hannigan-and-seth-green-are-worth-40-million>Alyson Hannigan And Seth Green Are Worth $40 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, which performer from Buffy is sitting at the top? Well, there seems to be a two-way tie here, as both Alyson Hannigan and Seth Green are worth an estimated $40 million each, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. This is more than enough to place them at the top of the list today.</p><p>Alyson Hannigan did great things on Buffy, and her career has been nothing short of impressive. Hannigan was also brilliant in the American Pie franchise, and on the small screen, she did fantastic things as part of How I Met Your Mother. It has been rumored that Hannigan was making $225,000 each episode, per ScreenRant.</p><p>Seth Green, meanwhile, has had a heck of a career, as well. Green has done huge projects like the Austin Powers franchise, as well as roles in movies like The Italian Job. On the small screen, Green has made a mint from shows like Family Guy and Robot Chicken. The man's career has been wildly underrated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other Buffy stars have done well for themselves financially throughout the years, too. For instance, Celebrity Net Worth shows that David Boreanaz is worth $20 million, and that Michelle Trachtenberg is worth nearly $10 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Buffy' Fans Marvel At 'Ageless' Alyson Hannigan As She Rocks Boho Chic</a></span></p><p>Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a legitimate classic, and it's amazing to see that the cast made bank over time.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>These Are Sarah Michelle Gellar's Most Iconic Roles (Other Than Buffy The Vampire Slayer)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZrp6Wrnq1tMRmrZqloJ6%2FpnnSpZiynaJisKK%2F02afop%2BYmsC1ec2eq2avn6fBqXnSmqmaoF2itqS0xKWjnmWXmrmtrdFmqpqkkafGcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-that-led-to-the-guns-n-roses-legends-divorce-from-his-famous-wife.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened that Led to The Guns N Roses Legends Divorce from His Famous Wife?</span></a>
