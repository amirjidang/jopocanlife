Honestly, we don’t understand how that happened; she’s since become one of our favourite reality TV personalities to watch/low-key creep online, and it’s surprising that it took this long for her to become as famous as she is. Okay, maybe she’s not Kardashian-famous yet. But we think she’s getting there, especially considering all the drama that’s been going on in her life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The break up between her and her 90 Day love, Jesse Meester, was a big one. Their relationship was already a little explosive, which probably made for a lot of heartbreak for Darcey (as well as some great TV). She’s doing much better now and has been posting selfie after selfie which shows us, and Jesse, just how good. Here’s some of the best.</p><h2 id=darcey-silva-has-truly-been-living-her-best-life><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Darcey Silva Has Truly Been Living Her Best Life</span></h2><p>Remember how we said that we’re surprised it took her this long to get famous? Yeah, she’s really relishing the spotlight now that she has it. While we haven’t heard much from her in the reality tv world, we have seen that she’s got a new man; and they look to be pretty gosh darn happy together!</p><h2 id=and-has-been-running-around-endlessly><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>And Has Been Running Around Endlessly</span></h2><p>After all the kerfuffle of 90 Day Fiance (and her subsequent relationship breakdown) it seems like her and her twin sister, Stacey Silva, have gotten even closer. JustRichest tells us that they’re even business partners now, which must make for some pretty intense sisterly bonding! No wonder they’re always working; they just want to be together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-and-her-sister-are-super-close><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>She And Her Sister Are Super Close</span></h2><p>Like, for real, really close. Darcey and Stacey are two of the most hardworking sisters outside of the Kardashian clan. And even then, the Kardashians seldom work together on ventures outside of tv shows. Stacey and Darcey seem to always be working on another project, as well as going out and hitting the town.</p><h2 id=like-really-close><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Like, REALLY Close</span></h2><p>Their social media accounts are full of twin pictures. Photos where they look almost identical, and videos where it’s hard to tell them apart. If their heights and body shapes weren’t different we might not ever be able to tell the difference between them. All in all, these two are super, super close, whether they’re working or hanging out.</p><h2 id=she-s-polished-and-professional><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>She's Polished And Professional</span></h2><p>JustRichest reminds us that, prior to getting sucked into the reality tv world, Darcey Silva was actually a very successful businesswoman. While we couldn’t find out any details about her professional life pre-90 Days, we can definitely tell that she was in business at some point. She’s just so polished and put together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=well-sometimes><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>...Well, Sometimes</span></h2><p>That is, she’s polished and put together most of the time. Sure, nobody is perfectly manicured all the time, but we’ve gotten used to seeing Darcey Silva looking all dressed up. It was always a surprise on the show to see her looking a little haggard and less put together than anyone else. But hey, she still rocks it.</p><h2 id=her-selfie-game-is-strong><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Her Selfie Game Is Strong</span></h2><p>There’s nothing more important when you’re a social media star than being able to rock a good selfie. Talent in the selfie game is worth even more than being able to hustle well (which we’ll get into in the next point). Darcey Silva can take an excellent selfie. Or, come to think of it, maybe it’s just the fact that she looks good from every angle.</p><h2 id=and-she-s-always-hustling><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>And She's Always Hustling</span></h2><p>The hustle is real, and Darcey Silva knows how to succeed in it. Not only does she have some of the best social media pics, but she’s got a whole lot of influencer pics up there too, artfully sprinkled throughout her personal posts. It’s pretty smart, and definitely speaks to her businesswoman hustle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-red-carpet-glam-is-always-good-to-go><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Her Red Carpet Glam Is Always Good To Go</span></h2><p>Yes, this photo isn’t necessarily as recent as some of the others. However, it definitely shows how her red carpet glam is always on point. Taking some inspiration from Kardashian outfits of red carpets past, this dress is definitely mesh (but very fresh). And just look at that amazing makeup!</p><h2 id=and-going-out-with-her-looks-like-a-time><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>And Going Out With Her Looks Like A TIME</span></h2><p>In general Darcey Silva seems like a good time. Sure, she’s not the most easy-going, but that just means that heading out and about and hitting the town with her is sure to be super wild. We personally love the idea of partying with Darcey and Stacey Silva, even though we’ll probably never get the chance.</p><h2 id=she-s-all-good-relaxing-too-though><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>She's All Good Relaxing Too, Though</span></h2><p>One thing we’ve learned through flicking through her pics is that, no matter how much hustle she has, she’s got just as much power and prowess when it comes to relaxing too. Her clothing brand business has given her enough money that she can definitely vacation whenever she wants. Or even staycation, like she is here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-pool-poses-are-stunning><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Her Pool Poses Are Stunning</span></h2><p>And we’re back on those social media pics. Not only was she rocking her social game before her popularity really took off, but she’s totally thrown herself into the deep end with it now. The social media pics she posts are far and away the hottest ones we’ve seen, mostly because they tend to take place poolside or in tropical locales.</p><h2 id=okay-all-her-poses-are-stunning><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Okay,&nbsp;All Her Poses Are Stunning</span></h2><p>It’s not just the background or locations that make us love her photos. The truly brilliant thing about her pics is her poses. Take this one, for example - she’s relaxed and draped over what seems to be a motorcycle in a pose that likely isn’t comfortable. But Darcey Silva makes it look effortless, which we totally respect.</p><h2 id=she-s-still-got-drama><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She's Still Got Drama</span></h2><p>Not only does she have the kind of personality that tends to attract big things, but she also has the kind of personality that tends to get involved in drama. Her sensitivity was one of the big things we noticed during her 90 Day Fiance stint, and that’s definitely carried over into her other interviews.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-she-s-not-afraid-to-talk-about-it><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>And She's Not Afraid To Talk About It</span></h2><p>All the more power to her, though; empathetic and emotional people are often hushed and shushed, or written off as being “too sensitive”. Luckily for us, Darcey Silva tends to talk about anything and everything. She doesn’t hide her feelings, and we appreciate the fact that she talks about all the bad stuff in her life.</p><h2 id=but-at-least-she-s-really-focusing-on-herself-now><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>But At Least She's Really Focusing On Herself Now</span></h2><p>In the same way that her opening up inspires us to open up more, the way that Silva has started focusing on herself inspires us to focus on ourselves. We love the fact that she’s started a fitness journey, and think that she looks totally amazing doing it. It’s still not enough to get us to the gym, though.</p><h2 id=and-her-personal-fame-is-really-starting-to-take-off><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>And Her Personal Fame Is Really Starting To Take Off</span></h2><p>We’ve touched on it a few times. JustRichest mentions how she and her sister’s clothing brand, House of Eleven, has helped their jean pockets stay full. That, in conjunction with her reality tv appearances, has made her personal brand absolutely skyrocket. Many of us recognize Darcey Silva now, even if she’s gone through some style changes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-highlighter-is-10-10><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Her Highlighter Is 10/10</span></h2><p>If a girl has good&nbsp;highlights,&nbsp;all the rest of her problems can easily melt away. It’s not that highlighter is the only thing that matters, but it’s certainly one of the big contributing factors to happiness. Darcey has excellent highlighter, as we can see from pretty much any picture of her (even all those classic pool pics).</p><h2 id=and-her-new-man-seems-to-be-teaching-her-some-new-tricks><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>And Her New Man Seems To Be Teaching Her Some New Tricks</span></h2><p>Forget about her 90 Day Fiance dude, Jesse Meester. Her new man is giving all of us something to smile about, even if her social media kept him cryptically out of photos (like this one). Keep in mind, this is coming after the Tom Brooks fiasco that happened as part of her second 90 Day Fiance appearance.</p><h2 id=yeah-darcey-silva-is-definitely-doing-okay><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Yeah, Darcey Silva Is Definitely Doing Okay</span></h2><p>All in all, we’re pretty sure that Darcey Silva will be totally fine without Jesse Meester. Pictures have proved that she already is doing great, and is rocking her new life. Her and Stacey remain as close as ever, and her style is getting more and more social media star-like day after day. What’s not to love?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: justrichest.com, biography.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhpaWWTlrultcNmp6GnpKTAbrvFZnBpZZSWxm6yyJqlnJ2jYrGivsKesGarmaHDonnToZitpJxiuqK3xGahnqujmnquscSsq56qXaK2tL%2BMoZyrZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-tv-shows-that-started-out-great-but-then-became-garbage.html><span>←</span><span>15 TV Shows That Started Out Great But Then Became Garbage</span></a>
