Today’s yachts are filled with more technology, gadgets, and amenities than most five-star hotels. In them you can find bars, swimming pools, hot tubs, 1000 thread count linens and oh so much more. All this comes at a rather steep price. Luxury yachts have always been a frivolous purchase, but there’s a significant difference between purchasing a yacht and purchasing one of the yachts on this list. If you want the best money can buy you’ve come to the right place. Here are the ten most expensive yachts in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-the-rising-sun---200-million><strong>10) The Rising Sun - $200 Million</strong></h2><p>Via liveyachting.com</p><p>Let’s start this off by spending $200 million. Just for reference, many sports teams purchased in the 1990s cost about as much. It’s the same price as many large skyscrapers and older sports stadiums, and it’s more than the gross national product of a handful of small third world countries – but we’re spending it on a boat, and not just a boat but the cheapest boat on this list! So what does our hard earned cash buy us? Well it bought <a title="David Geffen Net Worth" href=#>David Geffen</a> a large yacht that was originally owned by <a title="Larry Ellison Net Worth" href=#>Larry Ellison</a>, the CEO of Oracle. There’s a basketball court on it which can also be used as a helicopter landing pad, a movie theater, a wine cellar, and a total of 82 rooms scattered across five floors, all filled to the brim with opulence.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-seven-seas---200-million><strong>9) Seven Seas - $200 Million</strong></h2><p>Via fastlifeluxury.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Built by a Dutch company called Oceanco, the Seven Seas yacht can accommodate 12 guests across a series of seven spectacular suites which act as double cabins. There’s an opulent owners cabin that has housed its owner, <a title="Steven Spielberg Net Worth" href=#>Steven Spielberg</a>. Guests will find the rest of the accommodations to their liking. Amenities include a movie theater, helipad, gymnasium, and an infinity pool. There’s also an entire private owner’s deck for those moments of solitude, because fleeing out to sea isn’t apparently isolation enough.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-lady-moura---210-million><strong>8) Lady Moura - $210 Million</strong></h2><p>Via pouted.com</p><p>This yacht is so expensive that the lettering and embellishments in its name are made from 24 karat gold. This vessel is owned by Nassar Al-Rashid, a Saudi billionaire. There’s not much known about the Lady Moura – but what we do know is that it was the ninth-largest personal yacht in the world at the time of its construction in 1990, but has since dropped to 28th place. It is propelled by twin diesel engines that produce nearly 7,000 horsepower each. The Lady Moura is capable of comfortably accommodating 30 guests and over 60 crew members.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-al-mirqab---250-million><strong>7) Al Mirqab - $250 Million</strong></h2><p>Via de.wikipedia.org</p><p>Should you need to transport 24 of your closest friends to the Mediterranean for the summer then the Al Mirqab might be the yacht you’ve been searching for your entire life. Of course the current owner, Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabar Al Thani might have something to say about that. He’s the Prime Minister of Qatar – which makes us wonder if perhaps we shouldn’t consider a career in Middle-Eastern politics. The Al Mirqab contains ten bedroom suites, a helipad, a swimming pool, a movie theater, and a sun deck. There’s also a rather extravagant set of VIP suites set aside for the owner. Little else is known about this ship.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-dilbar---263-million><strong>6) Dilbar - $263 Million</strong></h2><p>Via teureyacht.de</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not to be outdone by their southern neighbors, Russian Billionaires have also shown interest in purchasing expensive and needless toys. <a title="Alisher Usmanov Net Worth" href=#>Alisher Usmanov</a> is the owner of this yacht. He named it Dilbar in honor of his late mother. The yacht is run by a crew of 47 and contains all the amenities one would expect when spending over a quarter of a billion dollars. There’s the apparently requisite helipad and living spaces that can accommodate up to twenty guests. The Dilbar is over 360 feet long and 50 feet high – making it one of the largest yachts in the world.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-al-said---300-million><strong>5) Al Said - $300 Million</strong></h2><p>Via charterworld.com</p><p>Al Said was named after its owner Sultan Qaboos Bin Said Al Said of Oman. There must be something about being super wealthy that makes you want to name things after yourself. At the time of its construction Al Said was the world’s second largest yacht. It cost a staggering $300 million and was built from an aluminum super structure. It can reach 22 knots and accommodate up to 70 people – and that doesn’t count the 154 crew members who work on board. Inside there’s a concert hall that can apparently accommodate a rather large orchestra – should the need ever suddenly arise. It’s believed that there are no photos of the interior of this yacht so we’ll just have to take the Sultan’s word that this place is pretty damn awesome.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-superyacht-a---323-million><strong>4) Superyacht A - $323 Million</strong></h2><p>Via liveyachting.com</p><p>Owned by Russian Billionaire Andrei Melchenko, Superyacht A is rather small for the vast amount of cash that was needed to build it. It’s crewed by 42 people and can house a total of 14 guests. It’s not the exterior or the size that makes this yacht so impressive – it’s the interior which is designed with every modern comfort you can imagine. On board you’ll find three swimming pools, all of which are built with an opposing current to swim against, should you desire one. There are two additional boats you can use to travel back to land or for recreation. The master suite can accommodate six guests by itself. Needless to say when you’re spending $323 million your yacht is equipped with the latest technology and entertainment systems. The exterior is also rather unique and reminiscent of a ship a Bond villain might call home.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-dubai---350-million><strong>3) Dubai - $350 Million</strong></h2><p>Via liveyachting.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This boat has been known by several names in the past. It was commissioned as the Golden Star by a wealthy Prince of Brunei, but later finished for Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum when he provided the financial means to complete the project. It’s also been known as the Platinum 525. Currently the ship is owned by the Sheikh of Dubai and it’s called, appropriately enough, the Dubai. Guests traveling aboard will find a swimming pool, a spa, a glass staircase and (of course) a helipad. This luxury floating city can host a whopping 115 people on board. It’s currently the world’s second largest yacht and we imagine it’s rather nice inside.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-eclipse---estimated-450-million---1-2-billion><strong>2) Eclipse - Estimated $450 Million - $1.2 Billion</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here’s a yacht that cost a billion dollars - maybe. We don't know the exact cost of building such a monstrosity, but various sources have listed the price of construction as high as even $1.5 billion. What we do know for sure is that it’s manned by 70 crew members and owned by Russian billionaire&nbsp;<a title="Roman Abramovich Net Worth" href=#>Roman Abromavich</a>. It contains its own private defense system designed to detect intruders and camera-wielding spectators. In fact, if you try to take pictures it uses modern light technology to block them. There’s room for 24 guests, two helipads, and its own private submarine.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-streets-of-monaco---1-billion><strong>1) Streets of Monaco - $1 Billion</strong></h2><p>Via ealuxe.com</p><p>Here's one we know will cost a billion. The difference between this yacht and number three on this list is $650 million – it's nearly triple the cost! So what does your billion buy you? Well nothing yet, this one’s still in construction. The design of this fantastic yacht is unlike the traditional model we’ve come to know and love. There’s all manner of things you absolutely need on the high seas – like a go-kart track, your own private beach and man-made lake, and a ship deck designed to replicate a city-scape. Included are reproductions of casinos and a replication a Monaco Grand Prix track. Scattered over its 550 foot length are tennis courts, swimming pools, cafés, and supposedly grand underwater ocean views. We can’t wait to check it out when it's done and sold off to some rather eccentric billionaire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OhnGZpYGK6sL%2FTZpyxqJWjwKrCxGawmpuYqcButc1mq6GdXay8s7jDaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-10-biggest-hollywood-studios.html><span>←</span><span>The 10 Biggest Hollywood Studios</span></a>
