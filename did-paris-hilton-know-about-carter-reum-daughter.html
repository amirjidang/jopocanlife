Amidst the news of the child he has kept hidden from the public, Carter and Paris announced the news of their baby boy in 2023, via surrogate, and a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">source claimed to Daily Mail that he abandoned his daughter</a> with Bellizzi ten years prior.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Within minutes of her arrival, he held her, kissed her on the forehead, handed her back to her mother, and left." The source also says he has not seen his daughter, Evie, 'since.' Fans speculate he might have kept this a secret for greedy reasons, and it could be for potential financial gain.</p><h2 id=how-did-laura-bellizzi-and-carter-reum-meet>How Did Laura Bellizzi And Carter Reum Meet?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2-17.jpg><p>In 2010, Bellizzi starred in the VH1 series, Secrets of Aspen, and shortly after the show aired she announced her pregnancy. Fans thought that <a href=#>Mel Gibson, one of the highest-paying actors</a> who pulled in a net worth of $850 million, was the father because Bellizzi and Gibson dated shortly before the VH1 series, but Bellizzi shut those rumors down fast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She publicly stated that he is not the dad, but it wasn't until 2021 that the father was named to be multi-millionaire Carter Reum, who reportedly signed a document in 2020 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"acknowledging he was the father."</a></p><p>Oddly, he apparently never took a paternity test to confirm before signing, according to sources close to him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Paris Hilton Have A Secret Stepdaughter?</a></span></p><p>Furthermore, neither Reum nor Bellizzi has confirmed how they met, but a source claimed that he isn't involved in his daughter, Evie's, life besides paying child support. A source declared that his lifestyle is 'nowhere near' the one his daughter is provided. "It's not even close," they remarked.</p><p>They went on to further state, "She feels more sorry for them than she does herself. Because they are missing something inside their hearts. And as a consequence, they are missing out on one of the most important things in life, something all their trust fund-leveraged millions cannot buy: a relationship with her."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-letter-from-carter-39-s-daughter-made-headlines>A Letter From Carter's Daughter Made Headlines</h2><p>Supposedly, Laura Bellizzi's daughter wrote a letter to her stepmother, Paris Hilton, and father, Carter Reum, shortly after their wedding in 2021. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">letter contained a plea from the young girl</a> asking Carter to have 'a relationship' with her.</p><p>In any case, it's heartbreaking when a child feels the need to go to extreme lengths to connect with their parents out of feelings of abandonment. It's not a surprise that many are outraged by the letter given what was written to the newlyweds, so soon after announcing the news of their first child in their marriage.</p><p>Fans also say that the timing of Paris stating how much of an 'incredible father' Carter Reum is on his birthday, merely two weeks after the announcement of their baby boy, is awkward.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Did Paris Hilton and Carter Reum's Wedding Cost?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The daughter expressed in the letter to Reum, “If you choose to respond to me I will be so happy."</p><p>Bellizzi also chimed in on the matter and stated, "It’s unfortunate to live in a society that systemically enables absentee fathers while overtly stigmatizing single mothers who are putting in the sweat equity of raising great kids."</p><p>Laura claims to want nothing extra from Carter Reum except the chance to give her daughter a relationship with her father. Reum has not spoken about the matter publicly, nor has Paris Hilton.</p><h2 id=fans-speculate-carter-reum-was-quot-too-eager-quot-to-marry-paris-hilton>Fans Speculate Carter Reum Was "Too Eager" To Marry Paris Hilton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/paris-hilton-and-carter-reum-1.jpg><p>Fans on Reddit theorize that Carter Reum has ulterior motives for hiding that he was the father to Bellizzi's child. They say he seems "too eager" to <a href=# rel=nofollow>marry the multi-millionaire media personality, Paris Hilton</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other fans say he seems, "too controlling." Could it be that he hid his almost non-existent relationship with his daughter in order to up his net worth?</p><p>Alone, <a href=#>Carter Reum's net worth stands at a pretty $40 million</a>, but his wife, Paris, is worth seven times more. They welcomed their baby boy into the world after two years of marriage, even though Carter Reum does not have a bond with his already ten-year-old daughter.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Paris Hilton's Husband Carter Reum Was Truly The Right Man For Her To Marry, Here's Why</a></span></p><p>However, despite their marriage seeming quick to some, Paris and Carter knew each other for over fifteen years prior to starting up a romantic relationship.</p><p>But this also brings up the question of how involved Paris was in the decisions Carter made regarding his daughter. It's possible they have resolved this matter behind closed doors since neither has made a statement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Laura Bellizzi had this to say on the matter, "Carter, his new wife, and his family will continue to have an open invitation should any of them decide to participate in Evie’s life."</p><p>Fans hope that Carter Reum recognizes the letter and fixes the relationship with his daughter, but so far, neither side has said anything since the letter circulated the media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdpa6ztdJmn6KkpKS7brfNqK5mmZKkwrV5wpqprZ2iYr%2Bmwcxmm5qtl53Bpr6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anne-hathaway-wears-daring-corset-dress-at-the-idea-of-you-premiere.html><span>←</span><span>Anne Hathaway Wears Daring Corset Dress at The Idea of You Premiere</span></a>
