Look at American history it’s been a pattern for 100+ years.”</p><p>He also cited disdain for song lyrics performed by the “Pushin P” rappers being used against them by law enforcement and offered his frequent collaborators kind words.</p><p>“Using song lyrics to indict n*ggas is lame af and a joke. These the same lyrics that have made billions for these corporations over the past decade. I’m waiting now to see who gon step up and use those same resources now that the coin has turned….” Metro Boomin declared.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>These brothers need love, support, and prayer right now not jokes, criticism, or opinions.</p><p>— Metro Boomin (@MetroBoomin) <a href=# rel=nofollow>May 12, 2022</a></p><p>Young Thug and Gunna were named among 28 others in a <a href=#>56-count indictment</a> on Monday (May 9). Both are currently being held without bond. Young Thug was charged with conspiracy to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and participation in criminal street gang activity. He was taken into police custody and <a href=#>more charges</a> were filed after a search of his residence. Gunna turned himself on a single count of conspiracy to violate the RICO act.</p><p>“As the district attorney of Fulton County, my No. 1 focus is targeting gangs,” said D.A. Fani Willis at a news conference according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “And there’s a reason for that. They are committing, conservatively, 75 to 80% of all of the violent crime that we are seeing within our community.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX668trrGZquhrZditLa6zZpkpp2kp7xurs6opKKmXae2pLuMnJ%2BaqpeawG59kWxrb25iaIB5ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yale-fentanyl-scandal-nurse-admits-to-tampering-with-medication.html><span>←</span><span>Yale Fentanyl Scandal: Nurse Admits to Tampering With Medication</span></a>
