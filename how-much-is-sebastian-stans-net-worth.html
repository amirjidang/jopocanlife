He made his way into the MCU earlier on in the franchise, but over time, his role in the MCU continue to grow, as did his popularity with mainstream audiences.</p><p>His time as the Winter Soldier has seen the character grow a ton, something that he talked about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in an interview</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"From from a point of view of the character, it was really nice to have that scene. We’ve never really seen [Bucky] let go, so to speak. I keep telling Kevin [Feige] about it. He’s a big part of Wakanda. That’s where his journey started again and it was just nice to have that scene and have it happen there and for us to have that flashback to give us context to everything else that he was doing," Stan said.</p><p>The actor has been such an amazing fit as the Winter Soldier, and despite all that the character has gone through, he still has an incredible future in the franchise.</p><p>This is a great source of income for Sebastian Stan, and outside of the franchise, he has been making some huge moves in recent years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Hilarious Interactions Between Tom Holland, Anthony Mackie And Sebastian Stan</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-is-landing-a-ton-of-work-these-days>He Is Landing A Ton Of Work These Days</h2><p>On the big screen, Sebastian Stan has been turning in great work for a long time, and it's finally starting to get noticed now that he is a popular figure in Hollywood.</p><p>Some of his most notable credits include movies like Black Swan, The Martian, I, Tonya, The Devil all the Time, and the recently released Fresh. This does not even include some of his earlier movies, which also played a part in getting him to where he is today.</p><p>He's also been doing some great work on television, too. The actor has been featured on shows like I'm Dying Up Here, and recently, he starred on the miniseries Pam & Tommy.</p><p>Stan was great on Pam & Tommy, and he spoke about having some big shoes to fill by playing Tommy Lee on the small screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It was, 'I don’t have a single tattoo on my body. I do not play any instruments. I have no experience of what being in a rock band is. These are big shoes to fill, and I don’t know why and how I could do this.'" he said.</p><p>Stan is thriving these days, and his net worth is proof of this.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie Are 'Taking A Break' From Their Bromance</a></span></p><h2 id=sebastian-stan-is-currently-worth-8-million>Sebastian Stan Is Currently Worth $8 Million</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Sebastian Stan is currently worth a healthy $8 million. This might not be on the same level as some of his other MCU co-stars, but Stan's red-hot streak will assuredly boost this number in due time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We have already talked at great length about what he has accomplished at this point in his career, but it is also important to shine a light on what he has on tap. Turns out, Celebrity Net Worth has some interesting rumors regarding Stan's upcoming projects.</p><p>"In 2021, it was rumored that Stan would be co-lead of the then-unreleased "Captain America 4." He has also been linked to an upcoming role as Luke Skywalker, which seems somewhat likely when you consider the actor's connection to Disney. However, he stated in 2021 that he wouldn't play Skywalker unless Mark Hamill 'personally calls him to approve,'" the site wrote.</p><p>Per his IMDb, Stan is attached to two more projects in 2022. He's going to be in Sharper and The Brutalist, two projects that have nothing to do with the MCU. This means that he is staying plenty busy away from his superhero franchise, and that he is collecting plenty of checks in between his Winter Solider roles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Fans Feel About Sebastian Stan's Pamela Anderson Sex Tape 'Research'</a></span></p><p>Sebastian Stan continues to grow in popularity, and it will be amazing to see how his net worth continues to climb in the next few years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Next: <a href=#>How Close Are Jessica Chastain And Sebastian Stan?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIyiqmarlZeutMDImqVmq6SWu7R5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8Gpew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gillian-anderson-daughter-piper-olivier-awards-2015-2015144.html><span>←</span><span>Gillian Anderson Brings Gorgeous Daughter Piper to Olivier Awards 2015</span></a>
