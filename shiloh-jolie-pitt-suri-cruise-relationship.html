Seven months later, their daughter Suri was born on April 18, 2006. In 2012, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes announced they were getting divorced after six years of marriage. It's widely believed that this is when Cruise became estranged from his only biological child Suri. The last time they were photographed together was back in 2012, when father and daughter visited Disneyland.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to multiple sources, Suri Cruise does not see her father due to his strongly held belief in the Church of Scientology. A practice in the religion called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"disconnection"</a> discourages members to associate with non-believers. In 2012, Cruise sued <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Life & Style</a> and In Touch magazines for reporting that he had abandoned his daughter. But in the deposition, he admitted that Scientology was one of the reasons why his ex-wife, Katie Holmes, had filed for divorce. According to a HuffPost report, Cruise “exploded in anger" when asked if Holmes left him in part to protect Suri from Scientology. The Church of Scientology has vehemently denied keeping Tom away from his daughter</p><h2 id=suri-cruise-and-shiloh-jolie-pitt-have-nothing-in-common>Suri Cruise And Shiloh-Jolie Pitt 'Have Nothing In Common'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to New Idea Magazine, Shiloh Jolie-Pitt and Suri Cruise never got close because they have "nothing in common." A source revealed, "A bunch of Angie and Katie's mutual friends suggested they have play dates when their daughters were younger. But both politely declined." Suri is BFF's with her mother, former Dawson's Creek actress Katie Holmes. The two are frequently spotted out and about in New York City together. "She and Katie are more like sisters than mother and daughter," an insider explained. "She basically grew up without a dad."</p><p>Shiloh, meanwhile, grew up in Los Angeles but "she's still very much a child, and her mum is happy for it to stay that way for as long as it takes," according to a source. Shiloh is reportedly much quieter than the rest of her siblings and is a bit of a tomboy. Meanwhile, Suri is becoming a young fashion icon. She is regularly pictured out with her friends in the Big Apple rocking her own <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">individual style.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shiloh-jolie-pitt-expresses-herself-through-dance>Shiloh Jolie Pitt Expresses Herself Through Dance</h2><p>Shiloh-Jolie Pitt recently went viral after performing slick choreography to Doja Cat’s latest song, “Vegas,” from the soundtrack to Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis.
