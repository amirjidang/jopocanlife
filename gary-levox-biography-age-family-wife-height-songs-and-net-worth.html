The lead-off single “These Days” was the group’s first Number One hit on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts (and reached number 23 in the Pop Charts). The follow-ups, “Love You Out Loud” and “I Melt,” were number 3 (number 30 Pop) and number 2 (number 34 Pop) respectively, while “Mayberry” was also number one (number 21 Pop).

While the band’s contemporaries, Tim McGraw and Kenny Chesney, started out with a neotraditional country sound, from the very beginning the band had a crossover-friendly country-pop sound.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gary-levox-discography></span><span>Gary LeVox Discography</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>2000 Rascal Flatts</li><li>2002 Melt</li><li>2004 Feels Like Today</li><li>2006 Me and My Gang</li><li>2007 Still Feels Good</li><li>2009 Unstoppable</li><li>2010 Nothing Like This</li><li>2012 Changed</li><li>2014 Rewind</li><li>2016 The Greatest Gift of All</li><li>2017 Back to Us</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-gary-levox></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Gary LeVox</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-gary-levox></span><span>Who is Gary LeVox?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>LeVox is an American singer and songwriter known for being the lead vocalist of the contemporary country-pop trio Rascal Flatts.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-gary-levox></span><span>How old is Gary LeVox?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He is 49 years old as of 2019.
