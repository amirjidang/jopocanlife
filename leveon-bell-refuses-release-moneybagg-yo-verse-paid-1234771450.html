He says that although he’s got songs with the likes of <a href=# id=auto-tag_snoop-dogg data-tag=snoop-dogg>Snoop Dogg</a> and late rapper Lil Keed in the stash, the only collaborative track he’s released is “G Code,” his 2019 song with <a href=# id=auto-tag_lil-durk data-tag=lil-durk>Lil Durk</a>. “I got so many songs with features on it with popular or ‘industry’ rappers that I just never dropped,” he revealed. “Like full mixed/mastered & everything! songs with Snoop, MoneyBagg, Stunna4Vegas, Tay Kieth,&nbsp;Lil Keed&nbsp;just to name a couple but I only ever dropped the song with Durk.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I got so many songs with features on it with popular or “industry” rappers that I just never dropped .. like full mixed/mastered & everything! songs with Snoop, MoneyBagg, Stunna4Vegas, Tay Kieth, Lil Keed just to name a couple but I only ever dropped the song with Durk ..</p>— Le'Veon Bell (@LeVeonBell) <a href=# rel=nofollow>July 9, 2023</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The rapper says that while his recordings with Snoop Dogg — which the rap legend recorded for free — and Lil Durk were great, he’s not so fond of his time working with Moneybagg Yo and Stunna. According to Bell, he wasn’t pleased with the verses they sent him after receiving payment, accusing them of putting minimal effort into their lyrics. “Moneybagg & Stunna4Vegas, I paid both for .. decided not to drop these tracks with these guys because honestly, I didn’t like their verses .. I feel like they just went in the booth and recorded something as fast as they could to get a quick couple bands .. Koudos, y’all got it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He added that his tracks with Moneybagg and Stunna will likely never be heard due to their lackluster performances. “Unless your Drake, SZA, or Rihanna, you gotta at least TRY or I’m not about to just drop the song just because your name is attached to it …straight up [100 emoji.] So that’s why I never dropped the tracks with Moneybagg or Stunna4vegas & most likely never will.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Moneybagg & Stunna4Vegas, I paid both for .. decided not to drop these tracks with these guys because honestly, I didn’t like their verses ..

Tay Kieth ain’t do a thing wrong to me, the beat cr*zy af, he snapped,” the former First Team All-Pro added. “Tay Kieth, RESPECT [fire emoji.]”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He also spoke glowingly of Snoop, who he says he secured a verse from while he was still in the NFL, and Lil Keed, who he worked with prior to <a href=#>his death in 2022</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tay Kieth produced the song that Moneybagg was on ..

He concluded his “rant” by expressing his respect for the aforementioned artists and producers while hinting that he’s looking to “hone in” on rap like never before.</figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>SNOOP I RESPECT YOU ?</p><p>DURK, I RESPECT YOU ?</p><p>TAY KEITH, I RESPECT YOU ?</p><p>KEED, I RESPECT YOU ?</p><p>you didn’t have to genuinely help me but YOU DID!</p>— Le'Veon Bell (@LeVeonBell) <a href=# rel=nofollow>July 9, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>and sorry for the rant ..

One of the premier running backs in the league during the late ’10s, Bell left the Steelers following a contract holdout, eventually being traded to the New York Jets and signing a four-year, $52.5 million contract&nbsp;with $35 million guaranteed, making him the second highest paid running back in the NFL.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He would later play for the Baltimore Ravens and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, with the latter releasing him from the team in January 2022. He has yet to play another game in the NFL.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He has since begun a career in combat sports, most recently <a href=#>defeating former NFL running back Adrian Peterson</a> in an exhibition match last year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Gyt7HOp2SbnZyherOxxa6qnqtdp7KtscCsnGaln6Oyuq7AoJ5msZ9iw6a%2B0p5kqZmZmXpyfpJtbnBpZGp9cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./laurieann-gibson-new-keri-hilson-video-she-did-have-reservations-55450.html><span>←</span><span>LaurieAnn Gibson On New Keri Hilson Video: She Did Have Reservations</span></a>
