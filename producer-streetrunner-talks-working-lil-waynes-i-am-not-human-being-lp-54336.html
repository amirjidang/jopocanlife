But ‘With You’ came together in about an hour.”</span></p><p><span>The track, which hit the Internet several days before the LP’s actual release, finds <a href=# id=auto-tag_weezy_3 data-tag=weezy>Weezy</a> rhyming while Young Money brethren </span><strong><span>Drake</span></strong><span> croons over a timeless Motown sample. Instead of riding in the background, Simpson’s melody plays the passenger with Wayne’s vocals at the wheel.</span></p><p><span>“Our intention was to make sure the sample wasn’t so low and in the cut. Some producers tend to boost up the drums and drown out the sample.” added STREET, who’s first big look came via </span><strong><span>Terror Squad</span></strong><span>‘s “Take Me Home” in 2004. “I wanted Valerie’s voice to be right up there with Weezy and Drake’s voices. It was about making everyone mesh together.”</span></p><p><span>Street says he originally thought the song would be included on Wayne’s forthcoming </span><span>Carter IV</span><span> album, but received last-minute word that Weezy wanted to release “With You” immediately. The last minute addition joined STREETRUNNER’s original I </span><span>Am Not A Human Being</span><span> contribution, the </span><strong><span>Jay Sean</span></strong><span>-featured “That Ain’t Me,”&nbsp;which came together with the help of another Cash Money family member.</span></p><p><span>“Jay Sean got the record when he was on the plane flying back from the Philippines, and ‘Im serious—he knocked it out as soon as he landed and sent it to me the next day. It was perfect—he had the melody and everything, first take.” STREETRUNNER continues. “Wayne first rapped over just the&nbsp;shell&nbsp;of the&nbsp;beat. There was no hook or anything on it.&nbsp;But after he finished it, I felt like it needed a little more of an orchestrated sound. I wanted that superhero music.”</span></p><p><span>You can expect more to come from StreetRunner and the Cash Money/Young Money crew. The producer is lined up to work with </span><strong><span>Birdman</span></strong><span>, has a record on hold for Weezy’s pending </span><span>Carter IV</span><span> album, and is also contributing records to </span><strong><span>Game</span></strong><span> and </span><strong><span>Twista</span></strong><span>’s forthcoming LPs. —</span><span><a href=# id=auto-tag_mikey-fresh_3 data-tag=mikey-fresh>Mikey Fresh</a></span></p><p><strong><span>SEE ALSO:</span></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6W%2FsLDUnJyrZaOpv6ax06usp6aVp3q1rcukqmavn6e4qrrGZqOipF2srrq6xKxkomWRonqvu9Nmn66lkaN6o7HIp55mpKBignV%2Fkm9m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paul-kruger-nfl-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Paul Kruger (NFL) Net Worth</span></a>
