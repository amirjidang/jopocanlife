Less than four years later, they decided to divorce, citing irreconcilable differences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Arielle Lorre is an influencer and YouTube personality who hosts a podcast called "Blonde Files," where she had hosted her husband often before their divorce.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">March 2021 podcast</a>, Chuck showed that he was still very much in love with Arielle, saying, "I thought you were amazing and a source of joy. You struck me as a warm and joyful person, and that was very attractive."</p><p>However, it appears that the writing maverick's feelings for Arielle were not enough to prevent their split, marking the third divorce for Lorre.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Did Raj Wear So Many Layers on The Big Bang Theory?</a></span></p><p>Before his marriage with Arielle, Chuck was in a long-term marriage with Paula Smith. The couple, who got married in 1979 before divorcing in 1992, shares two children, Nicole and Asa.</p><p>After his split from Paula, Chuck met and married Karen Witter, a Playboy Playmate, in 2001. They were divorced in 2010.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=did-chuck-lorre-have-a-prenup>Did Chuck Lorre Have A Prenup?</h3><p>Like many other high-profile celebrities, Chuck Lorre had a prenuptial agreement with Arielle Lorre.</p><p>When they announced their split, they mentioned that they were planning to "move forward in different directions, but with great love, admiration, and gratitude" for the time they had shared together. Having a prenup would definitely make this easier for both parties.</p><p>In the prenup, Chuck had agreed to pay spousal support and attorney's fees for Arielle, making it easier for her to move on.</p><p>Another thing that may have helped the couple make decisions about their divorce was the fact that they have no children, so custody was not going to be an issue.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-arielle-lorre-worth-today>How Much Is Arielle Lorre Worth Today?</h2><p>Not a lot is known about Arielle Lorre's business beyond her activity on YouTube, but she is believed to have a net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">close to $3 million as of 2023</a>. Since the couple divorced in 2022, this can mean that either the prenup Arielle signed with Chuck was for a small amount of spousal support or that it does not yet affect her net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Chuck Lorre's Worth Isn't All That Shocking, Given The Big Bang Theory's Success</a></span></p><p>Given how large the difference between Chuck Lorre and Arielle's respective net worths, it is possible that Arielle agreed to a modest amount in spousal support before marrying Chuck Lorre in the hope that she will be his third and last wife.</p><p>However, it is also possible that Arielle receives an impressive amount in spousal support, yet has decided to invest it, so it would not make a big splash in her net worth immediately after the divorce.</p><p>Either way, Arielle and Chuck decided to end their relationship on a quiet and respectful note and seem to remain friendly with each other, which is a sign that they have no hard feelings after their split.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoa2ToHqtu9GrnGacmau8s6%2FEZqernZ6qvXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-potoski-biography-and-net-worth-of-brandi-loves-husband.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Potoski: Biography And Net Worth Of Brandi Loves Husband</span></a>
