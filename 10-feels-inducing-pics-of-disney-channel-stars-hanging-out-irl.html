Over the years, some of these friendships stood the test of time while others flopped. Here are 10 feels-inducing pictures that’ll take you on a trip down memory lane.</p><h2 id=vanessa-hudgens-and-ashley-tisdale>Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Tisdale</h2><p>These two ladies have<a href=#> been friends</a> ever since they met on the set of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>High School Musical </i></a>in 2006. The two have not only been a part of each other's weddings, but according to Instagram, have been bridesmaids together as well.<i>&nbsp;</i>Over the years, their bond grew stronger and they are still the best of friends to this day! These two have over a decade of friendship on their side and hopefully have more decades to conquer together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nick-jonas-and-miley-cyrus>Nick Jonas and Miley Cyrus</h2><p>These two Disney stars <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">met </a>when they were only 13 years old. Miley Cyrus was working on Hannah Montana at the time and the <a href=#>Jonas Brothers</a> were hot on the music scene and definitely popular with the teen girls. They instantly hit it off at an event in 2006 and went on to date for a rumored two years. While the dates are not confirmed since the couple tried to keep their relationship on the down-low, it is confirmed that they were in love and happy at the time. Miley and Nick were loved by Disney Channel fans as a couple and everyone was devastated when they broke up, themselves included.</p><h2 id=zendaya-coleman-and-bella-thorne>Zendaya Coleman and Bella Thorne</h2><p>These ladies had their Disney peak on their hit show <i>Shake It Up! </i>The two were a dancing dynamic duo, best friends on the show and seemingly off-screen as well. Little girls admired the friendships the girls portrayed. As much as we all want to turn back time, we can’t. We just need to appreciate rare pictures of the two as a reminder of their time on Disney. Bella and Zendaya have gone on different paths, while the two of them are still in the entertainment industry, we, unfortunately, don’t see many pictures of them anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-gomez-and-david-henrie>Selena Gomez and David Henrie</h2><p>Selena and David played brother and sister on Disney’s hit show <i>Wizard’s Of Waverly Place. </i>This show blew up during its time on Disney and continues to be near and dear to our Disney loving hearts.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Most Succesful Boy Band Stars Of All Time</a></span></p><p>The two had an interesting dynamic on the show with lots of arguing and sibling rivalry. Although, in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">real life</a>, these two couldn’t be closer. Selena attended David Henrie’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wedding</a> and has reportedly already met his daughter Pia as well. These two seem to have carried their sibling-like relationship from the show into their lives off-screen.</p><h2 id=dove-cameron-and-cameron-boyce>Dove Cameron and Cameron Boyce</h2><p>Dove and Cameron were co-stars on the <i>Descendants, </i>but they were much more than that. Just from their Instagram photos alone, it’s not hard to see the connection that these two had. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cameron Boyce</a> tragically <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">passed away</a> in July of 2019 from a seizure. His death devastated his friends and family and definitely impacted his buddy, Dove Cameron. Any picture of the two friends is enough to bring tears to our eyes. This friendship is cherished by Dove and the world who got to see them through our screens.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=high-school-musical>High School Musical</h2><p><i>High School Musical </i>is one of the greatest and most successful movies to come out of Disney Channel originals. We already know that Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Tisdale have stayed close over the years since the movies ended despite their roles as enemies. It’s always endearing to see the other cast members together. This cast spent many years of their lives together playing friends on-screen as well as spending time together off-screen. In this picture we see the three boys hanging out years later. I guess it <i>is </i>true: Once a wildcat, always a wildcat.</p><h2 id=cole-sprouse-and-debby-ryan>Cole Sprouse and Debby Ryan</h2><p>These two actors are known for their long-term relationship on <i>The Suite Life On Deck. </i>The actor’s characters spent the majority of the show together which their audience seemed to love. Although there aren’t many pictures of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">these two</a>, their friendship has not disappeared over time. Cole and his <a href=#><i>Riverdale </i></a>girlfriend Lili Reinhart commented on Debby’s post about her engagement and the two even have recent pictures together where they reunited after all these years. It just goes to show how even though life moves on, good friends last a lifetime!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zac-efron-and-vanessa-hudgens>Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens</h2><p>Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens were the most adored couple on Disney for a while. The two played a couple on-screen and quickly took it to the real world. Although the two did eventually break up and Vanessa is now with long-term boyfriend Austin Butler, another former Disney Channel star.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Richest Ex-Disney Stars</a></span></p><p>Zac and Vanessa have both made names for themselves in Hollywood, taking them out of the Disney spotlight and into more serious roles. These two professionals have moved on from each other, even if we haven’t yet.</p><h2 id=emily-osment-and-mitchel-musso>Emily Osment and Mitchel Musso</h2><p>Our favorite Disney Channel friends, Lily and Oliver. These two played Hannah Montana’s best friends on her hit Disney Channel show. Emily and Oliver ended up dating in the later seasons of the show, although they were never together when the cameras turned off. Emily and Mitchel dabbled in music as well, releasing solo music during their time on Disney. These two have remained friends as we can see in recent pictures of the two. These two may be a decade older, but seeing the two together brings their fans a decade back in time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nick-jonas-and-demi-lovato>Nick Jonas and Demi Lovato</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick Jonas and Demi Lovato</a> have been friends since their early days on Disney. The two remained good friends throughout the years. Nick was brought on <i>The X Factor US </i>as Demi’s chosen guest and friend as well as was featured in James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke with her. In 2018, when Demi overdosed, Nick took to Twitter with a heartfelt message about his old friend. Although there was no response from Demi. Demi did not attend any of <a href=#>Nick and Priyanka</a>’s celebratory ceremonies, which leave us wondering where their friendship stands.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:<a href=#> 10 Child Stars With The Rockiest Childhoods</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYWV6p7HEpapmoZ6ZwqS1zaBkqaGTqHqwsoydoKymla56pLTAp6WepF2owaK%2B0mafmqaXnruoec6uq2ahoqF8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stranger-things-star-noah-schnapps-controversies-through-the-years.html><span>←</span><span>'Stranger Things' Star Noah Schnapp's Controversies Through the Years</span></a>
