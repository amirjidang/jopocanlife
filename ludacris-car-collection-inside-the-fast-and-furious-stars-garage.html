He is a successful rapper, having won three Grammy awards, and some of his tracks are also featured in the<i> Fast And Furious</i> movies. Ludacris’s massive success in the industry has earned him an incredible net worth of $30 Million. <a href=#>Like all gearheads, he spends most of his income maintaining a multi-million-dollar car garage</a>.</p><p>Ludacris owns a desirable set of super luxury cars from the pioneer brands like Ferrari, BMW, Mercedes, Rolls-Royce, Acura, etc. Below is a list showing the eight finest vehicles in the rapper cum actor’s garage.</p><h2 id=acura-legend-30-000>Acura Legend – $30,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This might not be the most expensive or luxurious car on the list, but this car has a lot of significance in Ludacris’s life. Like most celebrities, Ludacris also has a humble beginning. During the mid-1990s, before he shot to fame, Ludacris bought his first-ever car in the form of a silver Acura Legend. He is very attached to his first car and drives it around to date, clocking in more than 250,000 miles on the odometer as per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hot Cars</a>. The Acura Legend is powered by a 3.2-liter V6 block engine, generating up to 200 Horsepower.</p><h2 id=acura-nsx---160-000>Acura NSX - $160,000</h2><p><a href=#>Ludacris’ second Acura purchase significantly upgraded his beloved Acura Legend</a>. The Acura NSX is often regarded as one of the most underrated cars in this segment, boasting a 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged V6 hybrid engine that generates 573 Horsepower. This speed machine can quickly accelerate from 0-100 in a mere 2.9 seconds, making it a perfect ride for someone like Ludacris, who owns one in white.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mercedes-amg-g63---156-000>Mercedes-AMG G63 - $156,000</h2><p>Ludacris combined his gearhead and romantic sense and bought an all-white Mercedes-AMG G63 for his wife, Eudoxie. He surprised her by inviting her to the sets of Fast And Furious 8 and presenting the luxury SUV to her. The AMG, also known as G-Wagon, is powered by a 563 Horsepower twin-turbo 5.5L V8 engine that can zoom from 0-100 in 5.3 seconds, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CarHP</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>12 Of The Most Expensive Mercedes-Benz Cars Ever Sold</a></span></p><h2 id=mercedes-maybach-gls-600---200-000>Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600 - $200,000</h2><p>Yet another Mercedes in Ludacris’s garage, the Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600, is an absolute beast. Ludacris had this Mercedes custom built for him, flaunting dual-tone exteriors and the seats covered with Nappa-leather. He was so drawn to this powerful SUV that he bought it before it was put into dealerships. Additional features in the customized GLS include a pair of 12.3-inch screens, a Burmester 3D surround sound system, along with heated and ventilated seats with a massage function providing the pinnacle of comfort.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mclaren-mp4-12c---230-000>McLaren MP4-12C - $230,000</h2><p>Ludacris gifted himself this supercar in November 2013, flaunting the car on his Instagram handle. The $230,000 coupe is painted in black, while the wheels are driven by a powerful 592 Horsepower 3.8L M838T V8 engine accompanied by a 7-speed automatic transmission. The car is relatively light owing to its carbon fiber body, which accompanies the engine to take the super-fast vehicle from 0-100 in just 3.1 seconds as per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fastest Laps</a>.</p><h2 id=lamborghini-huracan-spyder---250-000>Lamborghini Huracan Spyder - $250,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A luxury car collection is incomplete without a Lamborghini, so Ludacris had to get one. He owns a Lamborghini Huracan Spyder, one of the world's most famous supercars. The Huracan is made for speed and is powered by a 602 Horsepower 5.2-liter V10 engine, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">21 Motoring</a>. The supercar has a lightweight aluminum body and can catapult to a speed of 100 in under 3.4 seconds.</p><h2 id=rolls-royce-dawn---356-000>Rolls-Royce Dawn - $356,000</h2><p><a href=#>Rolls-Royce is the flagbearer of super luxury and comfort</a>, and one of them graces Ludacris’s garage in the form of a dazzling Rolls-Royce Dawn. Ludacris bought this ultra-luxurious beast around 2019, cashing out a massive $356,000, and like most of his cars, the Dawn is also painted in white. The Dawn can seat four passengers and has state-of-the-art features like self-adjusting suspension, active cruise control, and adaptive headlights. Even though it is built for luxury and comfort, it is pretty fast, boosting from 0-100 in just 4.9 seconds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rolls-royce-phantom-drophead-coupe---450-000>Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe - $450,000</h2><p>Boasting a cost of almost half-a-million dollars, the Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe is the most expensive and luxurious car in Ludacris’ incredible fleet of supercars. The grand tourer offers the absolute pinnacle of luxury and has a striking white interior with brown trim made from a combination of teak, hardwood, and stainless steel. The exterior has a 2-toned color with a design inspired by the 100EX. The Phantom Drophead possesses a 6.75-Liter V12 controlled by a 6-speed transmission, and it is not just the most expensive car in Ludacris’ garage but also one of the most costly Rolls-Royces ever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ludacris’ garage consists of some of the most exquisite cars available. He seems to have a strong affinity for white color, and many of his cars have a white finish. Despite being a multi-millionaire with various vehicles, he still maintains his first car, the Acura Legend. The standout car in Ludacris’s garage seems to be the Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe, which boasts ultra-luxury, a powerful engine, and a price tag only a few can afford.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Look At Jay-Z's Dating History: All Of Rapper's Girlfriends, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Source - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">21 Motoring</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fastest Laps</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CarHP</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hot Cars</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8uum5qbop7Abq%2FAq2Scp5yhsqTAyKilZqGeqLalsYytn55llpbAtXnAp5tmnqWntrDB0maqrZmiqHqordGanp5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-get-kim-kardashians-sexy-victoria-beckham-slip-dress.html><span>←</span><span>How to Get Kim Kardashian's Sexy Victoria Beckham Slip Dress</span></a>
