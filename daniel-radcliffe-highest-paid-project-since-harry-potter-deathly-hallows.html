No matter how much the actor wants his child actor role to just be that and be more recognized for other things he has done as well. Of course, <a href=#>there was that one time he went full nude</a> for his role in the Broadway production Equus.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The most interesting thing about Radcliffe's career is that after becoming a millionaire through the Harry Potter franchise (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deathly Hallows alone earned him $50 million</a>), he has chosen more indie projects than blockbuster numbers. And he has even admitted that he isn't really sure <a href=#>what to do with his $110 million net worth</a>.</p><p>"I don’t do a huge amount with my money," Radcliffe told James O’Brien in his podcast Full Disclosure during an interview. "I’m not particularly extravagant. There are moments where I think, 'Man, I’m really bad at being famous.'" So it looks like he is more driven by the craft of acting than the money he stands to make when it comes to career choices post-Harry Potter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But that doesn't mean the public isn't interested in finding out how much he draws in as an actor. Especially now that he's slowly, but surely, easing away from 'the boy who lived' character (as the decades go by) and becoming more known as just Daniel Radcliffe, actor.</p><h2 id=daniel-radcliffe-makes-an-estimated-15-million-per-year>Daniel Radcliffe Makes An Estimated $15 Million Per Year</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/4-1.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Spear's</a>, a wealth management and luxury magazine, Daniel Radcliffe has an estimated salary of $15 million per year.</p><p>Which is shy of the $23 million he was paid for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallow - Part 2. But still a considerable figure.</p><p>The problem is, although his Harry Potter earnings are splashed everywhere, the actual salary figures for his other roles are not as well-known.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Emma Watson Only Realized She Was Famous When Entering School In The US At Brown University</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But Radcliffe has starred in some very high-profile movies since his Harry Potter days like Now You See Me 2, December Boys, and The Woman in Black. So it's very likely he's bringing in a lot of dough still, although his Harry Potter hey-day is behind him.</p><p>In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he recently starred in </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Lost City</a> alongside Sandra Bullock, Channing Tatum, and Brad Pitt.</p><p>And has also played the role of 'Weird Al' Yankovic in the satirical biopic Weird: The Al Yankovic Story.</p><h2 id=he-earned-this-much-for-his-role-in-december-boys>He Earned This Much For His Role In December Boys</h2><p>According to Spear's, Daniel Radcliffe made $1,170,000 for his role in December Boys.</p><p>He was 16 years old at that time and still very much a part of the Harry Potter franchise (it was 2007 when the movie came out).</p><p>The movie is about four orphan boys – Maps, Misty, Spark, and Spit – who are competing with each other to get adopted even though they are close friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Rupert Grint Reveals His Daughter Is A Potterhead</a></span></p><p>December Boys wasn't a big box office hit, but it was the first movie he did other than his Harry Potter films.</p><p>His <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">second movie outside of the franchise was</a>The Woman in Black – a horror movie about a widowed lawyer who goes to a remote village to settle the legal affairs of a deceased eccentric woman, and then weird things start to happen.</p><p>While his earnings from The Woman in Black aren't listed anywhere, it's likely he got paid a pretty penny for the role since it came out in 2012, just a year after the release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2.</p><p>Of course, The Woman in Black was a smaller-budget film, so it's very likely he didn't get paid as much as he did for Deathly Hallows - Part 2.</p><p>December Boys and The Woman in Black aren't his highest-paid projects after Harry Potter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=daniel-radcliffe-39-s-highest-paid-project-after-deathly-hallows>Daniel Radcliffe's Highest-Paid Project After Deathly Hallows</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2-14.jpg><p>According to ShowBiz, Daniel Radcliffe had a salary of $2 million for his role in The Lost City. A modest number, but not small by any means.</p><p>It was the same figure that Brad Pitt made in the movie. Although co-stars Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum were paid more. (Sandra Bullock was paid $10 million for her role and Channing Tatum got $2.5 million.)</p><p>And while his earnings from Now You See Me 2 are not published anywhere, it's possible he earned something similar for the movie.</p><p>Apparently, Jesse Einsenberg, the star of the movie series, <a href=#>was paid $600,000 for Now You See Me</a>. And that figure is estimated to have gone up significantly for Now You See Me 2.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, there was a lot of hype about <a href=#>Daniel Radcliffe playing the villain in Now You See Me 2</a>. So there's a possibility he was paid close to $1 - 2 million for his role in the movie.</p><h2 id=daniel-radcliffe-is-is-doing-fine-financially>Daniel Radcliffe Is Is Doing Fine Financially</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1-9.jpg><p>Even though his average salary per movie might have gone down significantly since his time in the Harry Potter franchise, Daniel Radcliffe is doing pretty well in terms of money.</p><p>His parents set up a firm named Gilmore Jacobs Ltd. to manage their son's finances pretty early on. And that decision is still paying them dividends.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are They Or Aren’t They?

That number has gone up significantly since then.</p><p>Of course, if one compares his current earnings to his Harry Potter days, it can seem significantly less. But that's a comparative fallacy.</p><p>His average earnings are pretty significant by acting standards. And cash-cow projects like Harry Potter and Twilight or even Indiana Jones don't happen very often.</p><p>So, all in all, Daniel Radcliffe is doing pretty well. His fans should be happy about that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmqaZmrluvsCdmqWhlpuybrTIoJ%2Beq6RivaK1w2anq6eamrC1edKipZydXZ2us77YZqeorKSav26wxJqroaSpYrWiuMuorqxn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-survivor-winners-where-are-they-now-scandal.html><span>←</span><span>These Survivor Winners Appear To Be Really Struggling After Being On The Show</span></a>
