In fact, it is the unlikely friendships that are rather interesting. Who could've guessed that the iconic actor and comedian, <a href=#>Jim Carrey</a>, has formed a close friendship with singer-songwriter, <a href=#>The Weeknd</a>, also known as Abel Tesfaye?<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Forget Jim Carrey And Keanu Reeves Appeared In This Film Together</a></span>Though the two are highly regarded professionals in the entertainment industry, they produce very different streams of media and content. So, how is it that they became so close? Let's get into it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-the-weeknd-and-jim-carrey-meet>How Did The Weeknd And Jim Carrey Meet?</h2><p>Jim Carrey and The Weeknd unexpectedly both grew up in Scarborough, Toronto, Canada. They were introduced to one another over the phone by the Sadfie brothers, a brotherly duo of filmmakers. The Weeknd was a long time fan of Jim Carrey after seeing his notorious 1994 film, The Mask, when he was just 4 years old, as he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>.</p><p>“‘The Mask’ was the first film I ever went to see in a theater — my mom took me when I was 4, and it blew me away,” - The Weeknd in an interview with Variety.</p><p>This seems to be a prominent starting point in their blossoming friendship, as Carrey also mentioned this in a 2022 interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Abel told me he was a fan of The Mask, and that was the first movie he ever saw, and that inspired him to be in show business when he was a kid." - Jim Carrey, 2022.</p><p>The Weeknd invited Jim Carrey to his place in hopes that he would listen and review his upcoming music. Carrey replied that he could see his place from his balcony, and so the two took out telescopes and waved to each other before Carrey visited him! Quite a wholesome start to the iconic duo's friendship.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is The Richest Woman The Weeknd Has Dated, And Is She Richer Than He Is?</a></span></p><p>And so, the two who grew up in the same area in childhood ended up living very close by to one another in Los Angeles after many years, successes and fame. The Weeknd also said to Variety that Jim Carrey set up big red balloons on his balcony and, to his surprise, took him out for breakfast for his 30th birthday.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Anyway, on my birthday, he called and told me to look out my window, and on his balcony he had these giant red balloons, and he picked me up and we went to breakfast. It was surreal. Jim Carrey was my first inspiration to be any kind of performer, and I went to breakfast with him on my first day of being 30.” - The Weeknd said in an interview with Variety.</p><h2 id=jim-carrey-s-unexpected-appearance-on-the-weeknd-s-album-dawn-fm>Jim Carrey's Unexpected Appearance on The Weeknd's Album, Dawn FM</h2><p>The Weeknd released <a href=#>Dawn FM</a> on January 7, 2022. It is his 5th studio album, a collection of dance-pop and synth-pop tunes that features many notable collaborations such as Tyler, The Creator, Lil Wayne, alongside spoken features including Quincy Jones, Josh Safdie and ... Jim Carrey! A rather unexpected guest appearance in The Weeknd's album.</p><p>The album contains 16 songs. Jim Carrey features on 3 of the tracks in total, narrating as a radio station host, satsifying the concept of Dawn FM. He welcomes the listeners in the titular track Dawn FM, provides the outro as he closes the 7th track, Out of Time, and narrates the entirety of track 16, Phantom Regret by Jim.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The final track is especially largely appraised, and is deemed to be a satisfying end to the story The Weeknd has been creating with his last few connected, interwoven albums. Jim narrates the entire song, and the lyrics run deep as the transcendent beat flows with Jim's voice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dawn FM seems to tell the tale of being trapped in limbo, the journey of accepting one's helplessness and lethargy. Self acceptance is a big theme in The Weeknd's music, however in Dawn FM it is in a more somber tone. It becomes especially apparent in Jim Carrey's narration of the 16th track that one of the messages in the album is, one cannot transcend into a higher state of mind and being if one cannot accept themselves wholly.</p><p>On January 4, 2022, Jim Carrey tweeted that he was "thrilled" to be part of the album.</p><p>The Weeknd thanked him in a follow-up tweet, describing their collaboration as fate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps their friendship truly is destiny, for the two entertainers who are differently aligned produced something so dear to the hearts of many fans.
