I just cannot wait to be a mom. And then once I actually did become engaged, I’m like, ‘Well, I can’t be pregnant at my wedding.’ Like, I have to be able to get s–t-faced.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Stassi-Schroeder-Admits-She-and-Beau-Clark-Were-Trying-for-Baby-Before-Engagement-02.jpg><p>The reality star gushed that she needs “all the Italian wine” at her nuptials and noted that she is “holding off” on conceiving because of her wedding dress.</p><p>As for her ex-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Jax Taylor</strong></a> and his wife, <a href=#><strong>Brittany Cartwright</strong></a>, the Louisiana native “hopes” they’re going to start a family soon. “I am so ready for one of my friends to have a damn baby,” Schroeder told Us. “<a href=#><strong>Katie</strong></a> [<a href=#><strong>Maloney</strong></a> is] too scared to be the first. Brittany wants to, so I’m like, ‘Well, keep at it.’”</p><p>Cartwright, also 31, admitted on a January<a href=#> Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen</a> appearance that she was <a href=#>trying to schedule her pregnancy plans</a> around the Next Level Basic author’s wedding, which Schroeder finds “sweet.”</p><p>The “Straight Up With Stassi” podcast host told Us, “I’m like, ‘You can be pregnant. I just want you to make it there. I don’t want you to be due during my wedding.’”</p><p>In June, the<a href=#> Amazing Race</a> alum gushed to Us exclusively about <a href=#>how “ready” she was to have a baby</a>. “I feel like I’m in a place in my life where I make my own decisions and forge my own path,” she told Us at the time. “I know I want to be a mom, so I would rather get knocked up before I waited to have a wedding. It’s powerful to let women know, if that’s something that you want, you don’t have to wait to get married. You’re in charge of your own body and what you want in your own life.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Stassi-Schroeder-Admits-She-and-Beau-Clark-Were-Trying-for-Baby-Before-Engagement.jpg><p>She noted that Clark, 39, is “on the same page” when it comes to their family plans.</p><p>Vanderpump Rules&nbsp;airs on Bravo Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasrJGowKp50pyfq6eVmbKzecGemK5lk6Gus7eMsJyrnV2pv7q1zaBkn6eiYq%2BirthmmZ6en6eybrHNoJignZ2au7V7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sonia-hooda-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-406668-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sonia Hooda Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
