Despite everything Carpenter has accomplished, many of her fans were more interested in other subjects in April 2024. For example, after Quiet on Set shocked Nickelodeon fans, fans remembered what <a href=#>Carpenter said about her mental health</a> after her time as a Disney star.</p><p>Another topic of much discussion in April 2024 was Carpenter's much-talked-about rumored relationship with <strong><a href=#>Barry Keoghan</a></strong>. With that in mind, many fans of both stars want to know what Carpenter and Keoghan have said about their relationship.</p><p>This article will look at <strong>Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan's statements about their relationship</strong>. Then, the article will look at what is known about the <strong>timeline of Keoghan and Carpenter's relationship</strong> as of April 2024.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sabrina-carpenter-and-barry-keoghan-have-all-but-confirmed-their-rumored-romance>Sabrina Carpenter And Barry Keoghan Have All But Confirmed Their Rumored Romance</h2><p>As of April 2024, <strong>neither Sabrina Carpenter nor Barry Keoghan have outright confirmed that they are or have ever been a couple</strong>. With that in mind, it may seem like the two celebrities have remained silent about their relationship.</p><p>In reality, however, while it is impossible for observers to definitively state that Carpenter and Keoghan are a couple, the evidence is overwhelming. After all, Keoghan and Carpenter have both said, written, and done things that confirm that they are very close at the very least.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ttweb_sabrina-carpenter-s-slow-rise-might-have-something-to-do-with-being-sued-by-her-former-managers_bk_a1_v4.jpg><p>In March 2024, Harper's Bazaar published <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a timeline of Keoghan and Carpenter's relationship</a>. As that article pointed out, Keoghan has repeatedly made several gestures that make it seem hard to deny that their bond goes beyond friendship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>How much older is Barry Keoghan than Sabrina Carpenter, according to Biography and Famous People?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>When was Barry Keoghan born?:</p></td><td><p>October 18, 1992</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>When was Sabrina Carpenter born?:</p></td><td><p>May 11, 1999</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>How much older is Barry Keoghan than Sabrina Carpenter?:</p></td><td><p>6 years, 6 months, and 23 days</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>One example of that is as simple as a bracelet that Keoghan once wore in one of his most high-profile red carpet appearances. When Keoghan attended the 2024 Oscars, he notably wore a Taylor Swift Eras Tour friendship bracelet with Sabrina's name and a heart on it.</p><p>To say that many observers swooned at that gesture is an understatement.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/fans-have-slammed-dylan-sprouse-and-barbara-palvin-s-relationship-for-this-ridiculous-reason-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Fans Slammed Dylan Sprouse And Barbara Palvin's Relationship For This Ridiculous Reason</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Dylan Sprouse And Barbara Palvin seem extremely happy together but some observers judge their relationship for a superficial reason.</span><p>On another occasion in March 2024, <a href=#>Keoghan's Instagram activity seemed to indicate that he and Carpenter were an item</a>. Keoghan's post was in reaction to a statement Carpenter made to Vanity Fair while preparing to attend the 2024 Oscars. While talking to the outlet, Carpenter seemingly joked about wanting to stalk Cillian Murphy after he left the Oscars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"If I see Cillian Murphy, I'm probably gonna leave the party. Probably gonna leave with him. I'm not going to leave with him. I'm just going to leave at the same time as him, so I can see where he lives. So I can follow his car."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ttweb_barry-keoghan-s-relationship-history-isn-t-as-squeaky-clean-as-fans-have-been-led-to-believe_bk_a1_v4.jpg><p>When Vanity Fair published Carpenter's comments, a link to the article was shared on Instagram. Instead of reacting with any kind of jealousy, Keoghan simply replied in the comments with a pair of emojis. "🙋🏻☘️"</p><p>While interpreting the intention behind emojis can be incredibly difficult, many observers took Keoghan's post as a light-hearted way of reminding his rumored girlfriend that he is Irish too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/how-a-life-thretening-disease-almost-stopped-barry-keoghan-from-appearing-in-saltbun.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>A Life-Threatening Disease Nearly Prevented Barry Keoghan From Appearing In Saltburn</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Barry Keoghan's role in Saltburn likely never would have happened if his life-threatening disease got worse.</span><p>The most noteworthy example of Carpenter possibly talking about her relationship with Keoghan came when she spoke to Cosmopolitan. While talking to Cosmopolitan for a profile in January 2024, Carpenter was asked about dating and spoke about what she is looking for in a relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sabrina-carpenter-had-intense-mental-health-issues-after-becoming-a-disney-child-star-deposit.jpg><p>Cosmopolitan's profile of Carpenter was published in March 2024. According to that article, rumors that Carpenter was dating Keoghan in January 2024 were "fuzzy at best". However, Carpenter wasn't linked to anyone other than Keoghan in January 2024 or the months after.</p><p>"A lot of it, for me, has been fate. I know that’s super broad, but I don’t actively look for it. The relationships that I actually want to put my energy into have to be so interesting or invigorating because they take me away from the other things I love. So yeah, it’s fun and it’s messy. I think I’m still just at this place where I’m really enjoying the newness of all of it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-best-confirmation-of-barry-keoghan-and-sabrina-carpenter-39-s-dating-is-the-timeline-of-their-known-relationship>The Best Confirmation Of Barry Keoghan And Sabrina Carpenter's Dating Is The Timeline Of Their Known Relationship</h2><p>While Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan's past statements make it seem like they became a couple, it is far from definitive proof. On the other hand, looking at Harper's Bazaar's aforementioned timeline of what is known about their relationship speaks volumes.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ttweb_shakria-and-ex-gerard-pique-s-decade-long-relationship-and-split-explained_bk_a1_v2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Shakira And Ex Gerard Piqué's Decade-Long Relationship And Split Explained</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>There have been a long of rumors about Shakria and Gerard Piqué's split which has left fans wondering what the truth is.</span><p>When <strong>Keoghan and Carpenter both attended the 2024 Oscars ceremony</strong>, the rumored couple didn't walk the red carpet together. However, Carpenter and Keoghan seemed to show off their relationship later in the night more than any bracelet ever could.</p><p>First off, Keoghan and Carpenter memorably took a photo together at an Oscars after-party. While Carpenter and Keoghan both covered their mouths when that photo was taken, the image still said a lot.</p><p>Perhaps what happened after that photo was taken still meant even more. When Keoghan and Carpenter left the after-party, they departed together as she wore his jacket to stay warm.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sabrina-carpenter-barry-keoghan-96th-academy-awards-vanity-fair-party.jpg><p>Another extremely telling episode from Harper's Bazaar's timeline came in March 2023 when Keoghan watched Carpenter perform live. Fan footage of Keoghan seemingly beaming with pride as he watched Carpenter perform without knowing he was on camera seemed to indicate how much he adored her.</p><p>According to E! News, it is believed that Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first met during a Paris Fashion Week event</a> . The duo were photographed together at a Givenchy show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Harper's Bazaar's timeline also detailed all the times <strong>Carpenter and Keoghan have been spotted together since they met in September 2023</strong>. After all, Keoghan and Carpenter seem to have been spotted on dates in December 2023 and January 2024. Then, in February 2024, Keoghan was spotted at Carpenter's home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqmpqinruiecKaqamdnqmys3nBmqmrsV2gsrCzx5qlZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGKxpsDAoqOsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./drake-metro-boomin-social-media-her-loss-1234826731.html><span>←</span><span>Drake, Metro Boomin Trade Shots On Social Media Over 'Her Loss'</span></a>
