This put his overall net worth at $100.7 billion, according to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Times of India</a>. In the races of the world's wealthiest, he's placed right underneath Berkshire Hathaway's CEO Warren Buffet, whose net worth is currently $103 billion. This is certainly attributed to Reliance Industries reaching a record high in the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stock market last weekend</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Mukesh Ambani is at the forefront of creating new businesses with new emerging technologies," chief investment officer at TCG Asset Management Co., Chakri Lokapriya, tells <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Indian Express</a> , "Creating businesses of scale at speed brings execution challenges, but he has demonstrated his capabilities."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ambani inherited the helm of Reliance Industries - a conglomerate that deals in petrochemical, energy, and natural gas - after his father passed away in 2005. Almost a decade later, Reliance has quickly become one of the most internationally renowned businesses, even being ranked <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">#55 in Forbes Global 2000 2021.</a> Last month, Ambani proposed a plan for his company to generate 100 gigawatts <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">of electricity through renewable energy </a>by 2030 in order to reduce carbon emissions.</p><p>On the heels of his momentous wealth milestone, it was released that Reliance Industries made- not one - but <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two acquisitions two green energy firms</a>. On October 11th, the conglomerate spent $771 million of enterprise value to take control of REC Solar, Norwegian manufacture of solar panels. Shortly after, Reliance's New Energy Solar arm acquired 40% of stakes in Sterling and Wilson Solar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There might just be a shake-up in the $100 billion clubs coming soon. As of now, each of the eleven of the world's richest are male. But, heiress to the L'Oreal empire, Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, may bring the billionaire boys club to an end. She's currently right underneath Ambani in the race of the richest with a net worth of $82.4 billion.</p><p><span class=next-single>Read Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>New York Billionaire Michael Bloomberg Signs Up For Prince William's Climate Campaign</a></span></p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Indian Express</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Forbes</a>, <a href=#>Business Standard</a>, <a href=#>Economic Times&nbsp;</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMamdpZZKeua21zqdknKSll3qqusOimKdlkp65rbXOp5iiqpViura3xKyfZpmdl66vtdJmpZ6sXay8s8DHZquorZOdsrR506GcZmlgZXqjtculoKimXaKus7eO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./teen-wolfs-tyler-posey-i-pulled-prank-on-costars-with-my-wiener-w160842.html><span>←</span><span>Teen Wolf's Tyler Posey: I Pulled Prank on Costars 'With My Wiener'</span></a>
