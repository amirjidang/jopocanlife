Paul admitted it was hard dealing with the paparazzi, saying he had very little privacy at some points.</p><p>“It got intense, silly,” he revealed. “I'd be taking the bins out in an old tracksuit and there'd be a guy with a camera in my face?

But that may be changing given recent reports Aniston is thinking of writing a memoir.</p><h2 id=jennifer-may-open-up-about-one-of-her-exes-soon>Jennifer May Open Up About One Of Her Exes Soon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar50290998.jpg><p>Sources claim Aniston is thinking of writing a book with an emphasis on the dissolution of her marriage to Brad Pitt. It came in 2005 after her met Angelina Jolie while flming Mr. and Mrs. Smith.</p><p>It’s largely believed Angelina and Brad had an affair, given they started dating so quickly after the divorce news was made public (and Angelina had a reputation for going for married men). Though they married and had six kids, Angelina and Brad have since divorced, but remain locked in a nasty custody battle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jennifer-aniston-s-mom-nancy-dow-did-some-truly-unforgivable-things-to-her-but-did-they-make-peace-before-her-death_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Jennifer Aniston's Mom Nancy Dow Did Some Truly Unforgivable Things To Her But Did They Make Peace Before Her Death?">Jennifer Aniston's Mom Nancy Dow Did Some Truly Unforgivable Things To Her But Did They Make Peace Before Her Death?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jennifer Aniston and her mom Nancy Dow were estranged for many years, here's whether or not their relationship was repaired before her passing.</p><p>“Jen knows people want to hear all about her love affair with Brad and the truth about their divorce, especially since Brad and Angelina have now split and Jen and Brad have reconnected,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source alleged to Life & Style.</a></p><p>“Jen has had a lot of therapy to make peace with her failed marriage to Brad and other romances that didn’t work out,” they went on. “But there is so much more to the story, especially about why they never had a child together.”</p><p>With some celebrities making multi millions from a memoir, the potential paycheck could be a big draw for Aniston (though with a $320 million net worth, she’s not hurting for cash). Still, a memoir would be a chance to share her story while making bank from it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to reports, Prince Harry secured a substantial <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$20 million advance for his memoir</a>, which hit the shelves last year, with the potential for additional earnings from sales. Similarly, Britney Spears is believed to have garnered a minimum of $12.5 million for her memoir, The Woman in Me.</p><p>Given Britney's <a href=#>expressed interest in penning a second book</a>, it appears to be a profitable avenue for celebrities, a path Aniston may soon be venturing on, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoyapaKrpKS7tHnEsWScmZyhwG6wwK2gp59dnbKzecinq56mo5p6s63RnmScp52isq%2FA0mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jaxson-lynn-woodland-age-how-old-is-gary-woodlands-son.html><span>←</span><span>Jaxson Lynn Woodland Age: How old is Gary Woodlands son?</span></a>
