Hill and Millar first sparked speculation they were expecting in March when photos obtained by the Daily Mail showed the Chassereesse founder wearing overalls to cover what appeared to be a baby bump and sporting a diamond ring on her left hand while strolling in Santa Monica."><meta name=author content="Tandra Barner"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The couple were previously seen together at the Hawaii children’s store Kokonut Kids in January.</p><p>The pair were first <a href=# rel=noopener>spotted</a> kissing and holding hands on a beach outside of Santa Barbara, California, in August 2022. News of their relationship milestone comes one year after the Moneyball actor denied rumors that he and ex-girlfriend <strong>Sarah Brady</strong> were engaged.</p><p>“The rumors are not true. I’m engaged. But not to my girlfriend,” Hill quipped via Instagram in February 2022. “I am engaged to your mom. I know this is shocking but <a href=#>please respect our privacy</a> at this time.”</p><p>Brady, 25, shared a similar sentiment at the time, choosing <a href=#>a fan-favorite Mandalorian character</a> as her faux fiancé.</p><p>“The rumors are not true. I am engaged. But not to my boyfriend,“ she echoed on her own Instagram Story. “I am engaged to Baby Yoda. This <a href=#>may seem like a betrayal</a> but I have chosen a side. Please respect our privacy at this time.”</p><p>The former couple went public with their romance during summer 2021. That August, Brady posted two selfies lying on the beach with the Superbad star. “My whole heart 💓,” the surfer captioned the Instagram slideshow, which included a <a href=#>photo of her kissing the actor</a> on the cheek.</p><p>The <a href=#>Oscar nominee</a>, for his part, shared his own selfie with the University of California, San Diego alum a month later. “❤️😍🥰 grateful for you @sarahhbrady,” he captioned the September 2021 snap.</p><p>Neither Hill nor Brady publicly announced their split prior to the Don’t Look Up actor moving on with Millar. Hill’s recent relationship status update marks his second engagement. The Stutz filmmaker <a href=#>previously popped the question</a> to ex-fiancée <a href=#><strong>Gianna Santos</strong></a> in 2019, but <a href=#>the duo split one year later</a>.</p><p>“The spark went [out] in Jonah and Gianna’s relationship,” a source explained to Us Weekly in October 2020.</p><p>Hill’s dating history also includes relationships with <a href=#><strong>Rita Ora</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Alana Haim</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Dustin Hoffman</strong></a>’s daughter <a href=#><strong>Ali Hoffman</strong></a> and high school sweetheart <a href=#><strong>Jordan Klein</strong></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In addition to finding romantic love, the You People actor has been open about his journey with <a href=#>self-love and acceptance</a>. In a February 2021 Instagram post, the California native spoke candidly about how shirtless photos of him published by the Daily Mail helped him realize the <a href=#>progress he’d made with accepting his body.</a></p><p>“I don’t think I ever took my shirt off in a pool until I was in my mid 30s even in front of family and friends. Probably would have happened sooner if my childhood insecurities weren’t exacerbated by <a href=#>years of public mockery about my body</a> by press and interviewers,” he wrote at the time. “So, the idea that the media tries to play me by stalking me while surfing and printing photos like this and it can’t phase [sic] me anymore is dope. I’m 37 and finally love and accept myself.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajp56WtW60yKWjZpmemXqwuMivoJplnZ65ra3RZqqem6Kawa3FjLCcpZuforJufdKtZJygmaGxbrDErZiipKNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-did-john-barrowman-get-canceled.html><span>←</span><span>John Barrowman's Controversies May Have Gotten Him Canceled</span></a>
