There's <a href=#>the "cringe-worthy" Cinderella starring Camilla Cabello</a>, and now, <a href=#>Rachel Zegler as Snow White</a> which Games of Thrones star, <a href=#>Peter Dinklage slammed for its backward story of seven dwarves living in the cave."</a> Recently, photos of Zegler from the set of Snow White (2023) went viral on social media — and fans have a lot to say against it. Here's why.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Marvel Movies Made Before Disney Bought The MCU</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-snow-white-actress-rachel-zegler>Who Is Snow White Actress Rachel Zegler?</h2><p>One of the most controversial things about this upcoming Disney film is choosing Zegler for the lead role. She was "relatively unknown." Fans think it's sort of a "disgrace" to cast her opposite Gal Gadot who's playing the Evil Queen Grimhilde. However, the 21-year-old isn't your average Hollywood newcomer. She's actually quite a promising talent who made her name in Steven Spielberg's critically acclaimed film adaptation of West Side Story. On <a href=#>how she scored the lead role as Maria</a>, the late composer Stephen Sondheim said that <a href=#>Zegler sang "like a nightingale."</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her performance in the Spielberg remake has earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, as well as a Critics' Choice Movie Award nomination for Best Young Performer. But despite her achievements, <a href=#>Zegler was initially not invited to the 2022 Oscars ceremony</a>. "I'm not invited so sweatpants and my boyfriend's flannel," the actress wrote on Instagram. "Idk y'all I have tried it all but it doesn't seem to be happening." It immediately sparked a reaction among the Latin community.</p><p>"She's the Golden Globe-winning female lead of Steven Spielberg’s Best Picture nominee and she's not invited to the Oscars. I wonder what's different about her...," tweeted TV writer Jose Molina. Latina TV creator, Gloria Calderón-Kellett also defended Zegler, saying: "How about the rare time that Latine people have a movie nominated for an OSCAR you invite the lead. Latine people are 18.5% of this country. ENOUGH." Soon, the Hollywood Reporter announced that Zegler was now invited to the ceremony. She went on to present the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects with <a href=#>Euphoria actor Jacob Elordi</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Hilary Duff Thinks She 'Spooked' Disney Into Canceling The 'Lizzie McGuire' Reboot</a></span></p><h2 id=fans-aren-t-happy-with-rachel-zegler-s-snow-white-costume>Fans Aren't Happy With Rachel Zegler's Snow White Costume</h2><p>Recently, photos of Zegler wearing her Snow White costume were leaked on social media. The consensus on the dress? It's a NO. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram's fashion police, Diet Prada led the discussion</a> on the "literal" costume. "Thrilled that we're seeing an actor of color play the role of Snow White," they wrote in the caption alongside a side-by-side photo of 1937's animated Snow White and Zegler. "But did they have to go so literal theme park princess with the costume?" Diet Prada also noted that production could have been more historically accurate with the wardrobe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I love Rachel Zegler, but I loathe that costume!" wrote a fan on Twitter. "It looks unflattering, cheap, cosplay in the worst way and more modeled after recent merchandise knock off designs instead of the classic slightly gothic old Hollywood original animated film! Meh… #SnowWhite." Commenters also agree that the dress looks like it was purchased either at Amazon or Party City. "Theme park Snow White wore it best," a fan added.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Johnny Depp Wasn't Disney's First Choice For Captain Jack Sparrow</a></span></p><h2 id=fans-commented-on-zegler-s-latin-background>Fans Commented On Zegler's Latin Background</h2><p>Before the backlash on Zegler's Snow White costume, the actress faced tougher criticism regarding her Latin background. Some fans think that casting the Colombian-American actress is "problematic" despite Disney's supposedly inclusive choice.</p><p>Another commenter clarified that Zegler's ethnicity isn't really the issue — it's the "fairest of them all" part. "I'm not too bothered by this casting."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clearly, fans have a lot to say about the early stages of the film.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Does Dove Cameron's Career Suggest A Darker Side Of The Disney Channel?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYq6zsYyhmK2hnpx6sLqMq5icoJWheruxxqWcq6tdqLuww4ywn6KslWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./erykah-badu-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Erykah Badu Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
