It <a href=#>may serve some relaxation</a> although buying one seem like burning a hole in your pocket with the price the yachts are going, which seems to be not a problem for wealthy people.</p><p>There are several expenses attached to the yacht aside from the actual costs of the yacht such as the maintenance costs and repair costs. Aside from these hidden expenses, there are a lot of headaches, and disappointments that only yacht owners can experience. However, for billionaires like J.K. Rowling, this is something not to fret about when she bought Johnny Depp’s superyacht Amphitrite. Take a look at the amazing yacht which used to be in the hands of Depp but now safely cruising with Rowling.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>CR7 Superyacht: Inside Cristiano Ronaldo's $7 Million Yacht</a></span></p><h2 id=archive-of-the-superyacht-vajoliroja>Archive Of The Superyacht Vajoliroja</h2><p>https://www.pinterest.ph/pin/382313455842600844/</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Vajoliroja is the stylish 156-ft. yacht which Johnny Depp bought in 2007 for undisclosed amount. Vajoliroja is a coined term after Va for Vanessa, Jo for Johnny, Li Ro for Depp’s daughter Lily Rose and Ja for Depp’s son Jack. However when Depp broke up with Vanessa Paradis and married Amber Heard, he eventually changed the name to Amphitrite, after the Greek sea goddess, <a href=#>which served as a wedding gift</a> to Heard. Depp is known to be an avid fan of yacht in his private life and he has always been fond of life on water which he was finally to experience when he bought the yacht. He used the said yacht to cruise towards his private island located in the Bahamas named Little Hall’s Pond Cay.</p><p>It was reported that the author of series of seven fantasy novels Harry Potter, British author <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">J.K. Rowling bought Depp’s Vajoliroja</a> for $27 million in 2016. The author reportedly fell in love with the yacht after she took the vessel out on some family charter trip with her immediate family. Depp had the yacht completely refitted in 2008 to boast some attractive vintage lines for some 1930s tycoon vibe which was constructed by Turkey’s Turquoise Yachts in 2001. This was done to suit Depp’s requirement for the design that resembles some classic gentleman’s yacht.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-classic-style-of-amphitrite>The Classic Style Of Amphitrite</h2><p>The yacht was built by the Proteksan Turquoise in 2001 and since Depp had the yacht refitted in 2008, it has never been refitted again. Two prominent Turkish shipyards has joined forces in 1997 to eventually form the Proteksan Turquoise Yachts Inc. With their combined skill set and experiences, they were able to make some winning collaboration which produces some high quality vessels. Their shipyard facility is located in Istanbul, Turkey where the world class yachts are made. The luxury vessel which is now owned by J.K. Rowling had some sophisticated exterior design and engineering which was done by the Taka Yachts and the ones who designed the interiors is the LM Pagano Design. The classic style of the yacht gives off some vibe of some updated and state of the art type of technology which includes Zero Speed stabilizers, some entertainment system and some top of the line communication systems onboard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The yacht also comes with some kayaks, board for windsurfing and dinghy which can be used by the guest of Amphitrite to enjoy some quality time while in the water. The yacht can accommodate guests up to 10 people n the five staterooms of the yacht which has room for crews that can fit up to nine people. The yacht can cruise comfortably at12 knots and can reach the maximum speed of 14 knots. The British author is reportedly <a href=#>using the yacht for holidays to some destinations </a>with her family however the superyacht can be chartered for $90,000 per week which used to be $130,000 when Johnny Depp still owned the yacht.</p><h2 id=the-stylish-accommodations-inside>The Stylish Accommodations Inside</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Amphitrite offers the guests some stylish accommodation with one master bedroom, two rooms with double beds and two rooms with twin beds. The yacht which was refitted to resemble some vintage bordello has a velvet finish overall and the color palette of the boat had some reds and golds. <a href=#>The Iconic Designer of exterior</a> Tanju Kalaycioglu intended the yacht to be a creation of modern design with some look of the vintage steam yacht. This was done using some non functional masts which was designed with some overhanging fantail stern, a smokestack and square wooden cabin top deck.</p><p>The superyacht features some typical contemporary luxury yacht which can serve as a helicopter pad which also has swimming pool and Jacuzzi on board. There are also some waterskis, and snorkel gears on board that will surely provide enough entertainment for the water lovers. There is also some entertainment inside the yacht including a satellite TV, some iPod docking stations and game consoles which can be played such as Playstation 3, and Wii.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Inside SYMPHONY: Bernard Arnault's $150 Million Yacht</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Club Yacht</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Luxuo</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yacht Arbour</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8inqqKclWKurrzHoquroaSaerW0xGaqrqiVp8air8etZKieXZ96rHnRqK6loZ6cfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-sopranos-cast-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>The Sopranos Cast Net Worth Richest Cast Members Salary</span></a>
