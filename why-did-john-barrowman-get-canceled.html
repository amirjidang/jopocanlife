Anything that gets posted online, even if deleted by the original poster, seems to somehow be archived, screenshotted, recorded, or stored to somehow come back to haunt the person many years later. This is how many people, celebrities especially, fall victim to cancel culture. And it seems that no one is safe, with many beloved <a href=#>YouTubers, singers, actors, and writers</a> finding themselves being massively scrutinized for things they have said or done in their past. And now it seems that John Barrowman, who is loved and known for his roles in both Torchwood and Doctor Who as Captain Jack Harkness and The Face of Boe, is coming under scrutiny for several instances of unsavory behavior throughout his career. And while the actor has spoken out against cancel culture in reference to his own career, it seems that he is starting to back away from the spotlight as his career begins to suffer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=barrowman-allegedly-exposed-himself-on-the-set-of-doctor-who-and-torchwood>Barrowman Allegedly Exposed Himself On The Set Of Doctor Who And Torchwood</h2><p>Hot on the heels of the revelation that his <a href=#>Doctor Who co-star Noel Clarke</a> potentially sexually harassed upwards of 20 women, it was reported that John Barrowman repeatedly exposed himself to his co-workers while on the set of both Doctor Who and its spinoff Torchwood.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Here's Why Doctor Who Dedicates So Much Time To Regeneration Specials">Here's Why Doctor Who Dedicates So Much Time To Regeneration Specials</a></span></p><p>Barrowman was an active member of the cast of both shows from 2005 to 2011, and again briefly between 2020 and 2021. The star allegedly exposed himself several times<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">,</a> although it appears those that worked with him saw the incidences as more of a prank rather than sexually suggestive.</p><p>Adding fuel to the fire, Barrowman ended up apologizing for pulling his pants down during a BBC Radio 1 interview in 2008. There is also video of Noel Clarke during the 2014 Chicago Tardis Sci-Fi Convention where he is talking about how often Barrowman exposed himself on set and would touch his co-stars with his genitalia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar43248298.jpg><p>There are also more reports against John Barrowman during his time on ITV's Dancing on Ice, where <a href=#>two contestants alleged that Barrowman had exposed himself</a> to them repeatedly, something that appears consistent with what he was doing during his time on Doctor Who and Torchwood.</p><p>Following these accusations along with his previous "pranks" may have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cost him his gig on ITV's </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dancing on Ice</a> as it was announced that Barrowman will no longer be returning to the show, although there is some debate online as to whether this is related to the allegations or not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=there-was-possible-tension-between-him-and-his-torchwood-co-star-eve-myles>There Was Possible Tension Between Him And His Torchwood Co-Star Eve Myles</h2><p>In a now-deleted Tweet posted by John Barrowman, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he appeared to throw a bit of shade at his Torchwood co-star Eve Myles</a>. The tweet includes a video of Barrowman and Miles at what looks like a press event for Torchwood.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Jane Fonda Confronted Lindsay Lohan After She Arrived Late To The Set Of Georgia Rule">Jane Fonda Confronted Lindsay Lohan After She Arrived Late To The Set Of Georgia Rule</a></span></p><p>Both Myles and Barrowman can be heard speaking in the video about how much they care for each other and what their relationship is like. Barrowman tweeted the video out with the caption "One is telling the truth! One is spewing rhetoric for an audience."</p><p>Fans were quick to respond to the post, suggesting that Barrowman reach out to Eve Myles privately rather than air out their dirty laundry on a public platform. Not only did the Tweet disappear soon thereafter, but it appears that John Barrowman also deleted his entire Twitter account.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans of both John Barrowman and Even Myles can rest easy knowing that whatever potential beef the stars may have had is a thing of the past. Myles took to Twitter to clear the air, assuring fans that she and Barrowman have spoken and that all is well.</p><p>Myles also took the time to address the rumors that have been circulating about a possible Torchwood reboot or reunion, assuring fans that both she and Barrowman would love to return to the show, but that she has not been approached by anyone regarding a reboot.</p><h2 id=barrowman-canceled-his-uk-tour>Barrowman Canceled His UK Tour</h2><p>Following the allegations against him and the sudden deletion of his Twitter account, Barrowman took it one step further and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">abruptly canceled his UK tour</a>, citing poor ticket sales. The actor took to Instagram to post the news to his fans.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="How Getting Cancelled Affected Whoopi Goldberg's Total Net Worth">How Getting Cancelled Affected Whoopi Goldberg's Total Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The post is a screenshot of text that reads "It is with huge regret that we have decided to cancel the UK tour. Unfortunately, ticket sales in certain parts of the UK have been slow, and with the increased costs of touring it is no longer economically viable to continue."</p><p>He continues, "This is a decision that has not been taken lightly, and I know many of my fans will be very upset, as am I. Personally I am devastated and like many people I have found the last years extremely difficult, possibly the hardest few years of my life."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar50931721.jpg><p>Barrowman closes off his statement by saying "When it gets tough it is sometimes better to stop and re-evaluate and that is exactly what I am going to do. I am so sorry to all my fans."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is unclear if ticket sales are slow because of the allegations against him, or because of the housing crisis many in the UK are experiencing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecmon6dlkpa%2Fs7vWppinZZeawW6vwKeanqSVmXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-stewart-net-worth-2.html><span>←</span><span>James Stewart Net Worth How Much is Stewart Worth?</span></a>
