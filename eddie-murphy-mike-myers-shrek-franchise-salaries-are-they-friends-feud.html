The movie was a huge success and went on to spawn several sequels.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Mike Myers Said This About The Future Of “Shrek”</a></span></p><p><a href=#>Myers wasn't even originally considered for the Shrek role</a>, and Murphy's road to becoming Donkey wasn't that easy. Despite those hurdles, their portrayals of those characters have become insanely iconic. Part of this is due to the chemistry between their actors, but did Myers and Murphy truly get along behind the scenes? Were they paid fairly for their amazing performances? Here's everything to know.</p><h2 id=how-much-money-did-eddie-murphy-make-from-the-shrek-franchise>How Much Money Did Eddie Murphy Make From The Shrek Franchise?</h2><p>Murphy's role as Donkey in the Shrek film franchise is undoubtedly one of his most iconic performances. His portrayal of the witty and lovable sidekick has won the hearts of audiences worldwide, making the film a box office success. But just how much money did Eddie Murphy make from the Shrek movies?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/eddie-murphy-regretted-turning-down-a-franchise-that-made-714-million-at-the-box-office.jpg><p>One aspect to consider is Murphy's salary per Shrek movie.

He also receives royalties for his voice acting contributions to merchandise sales, DVD sales, and television syndication deals. These earnings can add up to millions of dollars over time.</p><p>It's a good thing Murphy has banked on being in the Shrek franchise. He did once <a href=#>miss out on being in the lucrative Ghostbusters series</a>.</p><h2 id=how-much-money-did-mike-myers-make-from-the-shrek-franchise>How Much Money Did Mike Myers Make From The Shrek Franchise?</h2><p>One of the key players behind this success is Myers, who voiced the beloved character of Shrek in all four movies.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here’s What Mike Myers Said About Working With Beyoncé</a></span></p><p>According to The Richest, Myers earned a staggering $3 million for his role in the first Shrek film released in 2001. This sum might seem astronomical to some, but it pales in comparison to what he made in subsequent films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For example, Myers reportedly earned $10 million for his performance in Shrek 2 and a staggering $15 million for Shrek the Third. These figures demonstrate how much value producers placed on Myers' contributions to the series. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Myers has a total net worth of $200 million. Shrek clearly has played a huge part in that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1UkbyppyfEnMIEFbAuV7Ap2eBfU-BbtVNn-_kdcvbnw.jpeg><p>But why was Myers paid so much? One reason could be that he was considered an A-list celebrity at the time and had already starred in successful films such as Wayne's World and Austin Powers. Therefore, he brought with him a certain level of fame and popularity that could attract audiences to the franchise. Additionally, Myers' comedic talent helped make Shrek a hit among both children and adults alike.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It has been a while since Myers has been the lead in anything too big. Some fans believe it's by choice, while some critics point to <a href=#>Myer's behavior and antics on the set of movies such as Wayne's World</a> as the reason why.</p><h2 id=are-mike-myers-and-eddie-murphy-friends>Are Mike Myers And Eddie Murphy Friends?</h2><p>Working on a film set requires a lot of collaboration between the cast and crew members. Each person has their own unique role to play, but they must all work together to create a cohesive final product. This was certainly the case for Myers and Murphy when they worked together on the animated classic, Shrek. Despite having vastly different backgrounds and approaches to comedy, these two talented actors managed to find common ground and work collaboratively on set.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the key factors that contributed to this successful collaboration was mutual respect. Both Myers and Murphy were well-respected in their respective fields before coming together for Shrek, and they recognized each other's talents from the outset. Rather than letting their egos get in the way, they approached each other with an open mind and a willingness to learn from one another.</p><p>Another important factor that helped facilitate collaboration on set was communication. Working on an animated film requires a lot of coordination between voice actors, animators, and directors. Myers and Murphy understood this dynamic well, and they made sure to communicate clearly with each other throughout the production process. They would discuss their lines together before recording them, ensuring that they were both on the same page in terms of tone and delivery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/eddie-murphy-and-mike-myers-made-millions-together-thanks-to-the-shrek-franchise-but-do-they-actually-like-each-other_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps most importantly, though, Myers and Murphy had fun working together. Although they came from very different comedic backgrounds - Myers is known for his deadpan humor while Murphy is more energetic - they found ways to make each other laugh on set. This lighthearted atmosphere helped them relax into their roles as Shrek and Donkey, allowing them to deliver performances that were both funny and heartfelt.</p><p>According to CBR, Myers initially struggled with finding the right voice for Shrek and would frequently ask for additional takes. However, once he found his groove, he brought a unique blend of humor and heart to the character.</p><p>On the other hand, Murphy's performance as Donkey was an instant hit with audiences. His quick-witted one-liners and infectious energy made him a fan favorite.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite these creative contrasts, both actors acknowledged each other's talents on numerous occasions. In fact, during an interview with Entertainment Weekly in 2001, Myers praised Murphy's comedic timing stating "Eddie is just brilliant."</p><p>Similarly, Murphy acknowledged Myers' contributions to the film during an interview with E! News saying "I think Mike did an incredible job bringing life to this character".</p><p>However, there have been rumors over the years about a potential collaboration sequel or spinoff in the Shrek franchise. With the recent success of the Puss in Boots sequel, the hype around a Shrek 5 has not only increased <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">but is finally believed to be happening</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicnZyZmnquwdGpn7JlnZ64pnnMspyrq12otbOxymadq5memLWqv8Rmqpqkkae2pr%2BMmqmeZaSdsrp5xaugnqaUqHqnsdSdZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-armie-hammer-want-call-me-by-your-name-sequel.html><span>←</span><span>Did Armie Hammer Even Want To Make The 'Call Me By Your Name' Sequel?</span></a>
