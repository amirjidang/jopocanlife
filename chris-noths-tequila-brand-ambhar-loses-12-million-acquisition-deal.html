Zoe and Lily spoke separately in recent months to the outlet, and reports say they do not know each other. Zoe claims that she met Noth in 2004 at 22 when she began to work at a media firm. At the time, Noth was 49 years old. Her former boss supported her claim that Noth left her some voicemails and was seen talking to her at her desk. When she meets Noth, she says that he misbehaved with her despite her protest. On the other hand, Lily met Noth in the New York nightclub in 2015 when he was 60, and she was 25. She affirms that Noth invited her to his apartment and misbehaved with her, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mail Online</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Entertainment Arts is joining Peloton, the latter pulled an ad featuring Noth. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a> says that the video was an attempt to make light of a scene in which Noth’s character, Mr. Big, dies of a heart attack. Apart from the company backing away from the actor after the accusations surfaced Thursday, Noth has also been dropped from A3 Artist Agency, a talent agency in Los Angeles, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a>.</p><p>Noth released a statement to <a href=#>Fox News</a> digital denying the acquisitions. In that, he said, “The Acquisitions made by the individual against me are false. The encounters were consensual. I don’t know why they are surfacing now, but I know that I did not assault these women”. He also states that he has not and would never cross that line.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>BTS Ranks No. 1 On Billboard’s Digital Song Sales Chart, Beats Taylor Swift</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mail Online</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSwqb7IrGSnp6SdwG7AxKqsoqSRYq%2Bzrc2dZJqlkp2us3nLqKqeq11mf265yKWjoqeeYq6kvdSiqqKsmaS7brDEmqNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chip-joanna-gaines-magnolia-network-pulls-home-work-after-alleged-makeover-missteps.html><span>←</span><span>Chip, Joanna Gaines Magnolia Network pulls Home Work after alleged makeover missteps WS</span></a>
