Green, James Worthy and one of the first Laker Girls, Paula Abdul.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Lakers Nation</a>, a large birthday cake made it on to the court during half time and <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Snoop Dogg</a> appeared in a video to lead the crowd in a 'Happy Birthday' song for the celebration. Friends and family spoke of Abdul-Jabbar’s influence, not only throughout his NBA career, but by contributing to conversations about race, religion and other social justice issues.</p><p>Let’s take a look back at the NBA star’s career and the incredible impact he’s made both on and off the court.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-tower-from-power>The Tower From Power</h2><p>Born Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Jr., Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was 6’8” tall by the time he was in the eighth grade. At age 12, he was able to dunk and his basketball talent was a given.

He worked as an assistant and mentor for the Los Angeles Clippers and Seattle Supersonics. He also worked as a scout for the New York Knicks and then as a special assistant coach for the Lakers from 2005-2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-career-in-writing-entertainment>A Career in Writing/ Entertainment</h2><p>Surprisingly, the former basketball player found his voice on the pages of several New York Times bestsellers.
