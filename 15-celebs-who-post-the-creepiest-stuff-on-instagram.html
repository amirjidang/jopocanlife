Whether it was the royals, generals, or other world leaders in the times of yore, they had stories written about their adventures and the events of their lives were discussed far and wide. Then, with the advent of the printing press, various ways of recording music and voices, movies, and the internet, it became easier by the year to follow the famous among us. That said, the world’s perception of those that are able to become renowned around the world was forever changed yet again with the creation of social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These days, through Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, and other similar websites and apps, famous people become more accessible all of the time. Sure, there are still some holdouts when it comes to celebs but there is no doubt that the majority of people in the spotlight have turned to these avenues to get their name, faces, and projects out there. As a side effect of this, however, the rest of us have gotten an interesting view of the personal lives of these folks we could never have imagined before. In some cases, the result of this is downright creepy. And through Instagram, a site and app that is based predominantly on photos and videos, that is even easier. Realizing this is what inspired us to put together this list of fifteen celebrities who post the creepiest stuff on Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In order for someone to be up for consideration here, they should&nbsp;have become famous for one reason or another. Therefore, if they are known for acting, music, television hosting, or any other kind of work, it doesn’t matter as long as a significant group of people are aware of them. Next, they need to have an Instagram account where they post things that can be construed as creepy. We should point out, though, there are a few accounts here that are not verified, but we’ve done what we can to be sure they belong to the celebrity in question. It is also possible that some of these accounts may be operated by someone with access to the celebrity on their behalf but since they are representations of the star, that doesn’t matter to us.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kat-von-d><strong>Kat Von D</strong></h2><p>A tattoo artist that gained notoriety for playing a part in “reality” shows like LA Ink, <a href=#>Kat Von D</a> has a distinctive style and look that is highlighted by her inked body and face. Also a model, musician, entrepreneur, and television personality who has shown herself to be very well-spoken in public appearances, she seems to have made the most of her time in the spotlight. If the fact that she was even an unlockable skater in the game Tony Hawk: Ride even though she isn’t famous for the sport doesn’t show that she has a long list of fans, we don’t know what will.</p><p>Judging by the gothic nature of much of her ink, it shouldn’t come as any surprise that her Instagram has images that definitely bring to mind a similar style. Between creepy drawings of movie characters, extreme closeups of heavily made up parts of faces that seem altogether spooky, and a lot more, she is a perfect fit for this list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=spencer-pratt><strong>Spencer Pratt</strong></h2><p>Principally famous for being a massive douchebag, <a href=#>Spencer Pratt</a> came to prominence due to appearances in reality TV. Starting out in a forgotten show called The Princes of Malibu where he appeared with the Jenner brothers, once it came to an end, he would go on to latch on to another famous person. In this case, he became a mainstay of The Hills by becoming romantically involved with <a href=#>Heidi Montag</a>, one of its stars. Pretty much constantly portrayed as a jerk, he seemed to revel in the role as evidenced by his sometimes over-the-top antics that seemed designed to anger viewers.</p><p>That is why it comes as no surprise to us that his Instagram account, though not used much, will creep you out due to how much of a d*ck it makes him look like. A testament to the fact that someone can become a celebrity strictly for being a d*ck, his photos of himself doing Martial Arts, standing shirtless with a gross beard, and looking intense should embarrass society.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alice-cooper><strong>Alice Cooper</strong></h2><p>An absolute rock legend, <a href=#>Alice Cooper</a> has had a truly fascinating career. Like Kiss or Gwar or other bands that heavily rely on their image, Alice is known for a very distinctive look but has also released some songs that are amazing on their own. Still going strong today, he continues to play music for fans and in our opinion, one hundred percent deserves his inclusion in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame alongside his original band. With an Instagram account that falls in line perfectly with his long-crafted persona, it includes photos of his performances but it is the snakes and guillotine that put it over the edge for us.</p><h2 id=justin-bieber><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></h2><p>One of the biggest pop stars in recent years, <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> started out his career as a fresh-faced youngster singing songs on YouTube. Going on to be one of the most successful musical performers of his generation, his hordes of preteen fans began to call themselves Beliebers because they were that loyal to him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the fact that he has sold more than one hundred million records to date, it has been his personal life that seems to get the lion’s share of the attention. That is why we find his Instagram all the more cringe-worthy because he seems to lack any kind of self-awareness judging by the pictures he uploads. Largely looking as though he is totally egotistical due to showing off his affluent lifestyle, his body, and attempting to look deep, if you are like us, it has the opposite effect. Even worse, however, and the reason we’ve chosen to include his account here is the comment section that seems filled to the brim with followers that believe in him like a cult leader.</p><h2 id=abyss><strong>Abyss</strong></h2><p>Not exactly the same caliber of star as wrestlers like <a href=#>Hulk Hogan</a>, <a href=#>Steve Austin</a>, <a href=#>The Rock</a>, or <a href=#>John Cena</a>, Abyss has never stepped foot in a WWE ring but has still had a notable career. Best known because of working for the company that has been known as TNA and Impact Wrestling, he plays a sadomasochist character that is brutal to the bodies of his foes and at times, himself. As a result, it should come as no surprise that many of the pictures he uploads on Instagram are designed to freak people out. Sure, it is all a character that he is playing but judging by the real man’s willingness to damage his body for our entertainment, we’re guessing there is a little bit of truth to it too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wes-borland><strong>Wes Borland</strong></h2><p>Best known as the guitarist and backup singer in the nu metal band Limp Bizkit, Wes Borland actually seems to have the most charisma in the group. Often performing in outrageous outfits and makeup all over his face and body, it gives a really striking quality to his appearances onstage. In fact, when he left the band after the height of its popularity, there were some people that felt that his departure led to its dwindling sales instead of their genre of music faltering. With an Instagram account that combines images of him in his crazy getups, photos of blades, disturbing movie characters like Eraserhead and more, it is cool but off-putting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=insane-clown-posse><strong>Insane Clown Posse</strong></h2><p>The duo that is till trying to figure out how magnets work, the Insane Clown Posse, despite being decried for years on end, have shown a shocking level of staying power. These two “horrorcore” rappers have put out a lot of music over the years, which has been supported by their fiercely loyal fans that identify themselves as Juggalos. On top of that, they’ve also made a mint from extensive touring. Jacks of all trade, they’ve also made forays into the wrestling business, having worked for their own company as well as the WWE and WCW, and released several movies. In short, they have found success doing just about everything including creeping us out on Instagram where their killer clown personas are quite macabre.</p><h2 id=kesha><strong>Kesha</strong></h2><p>A singer and rapper who is best known for a personal style with songs that come off as down and dirty, <a href=#>Kesha</a> has played many hit songs. Famous for tracks like “Tik Tok,” “We R Who We R,” “Die Young,” and more as well as guesting on songs by other artists, including <a href=#>Pitbull</a>, this young performer has made her mark on the industry. Unfortunately, in recent years, she has all but disappeared from the music scene but has remained a point of discussion as she attempts to break free from a binding contract. Judging by her Instagram account, however, it looks like little has changed as it remains the home of photos of her hard partying ways. We’re fine with having some fun but when there are photos of you licking other people’s noses, glitter-filled toilets, and wildlife alongside revealing photos of your body, it becomes just plain odd.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=madonna><strong>Madonna</strong></h2><p>One of the most groundbreaking artists of the last several decades, <a href=#>Madonna</a> has proven herself capable of reinventing herself many times over the years, mostly in a manner that has rejuvenated her career. Often called the Queen of Pop, she has released more hit songs than almost anyone, including tracks like “Papa Don’t Preach,” “Vogue,” and “Frozen,” to name a fraction. Recognized as the best-selling female recording artist of all time by Guinness World Records, she is an absolute legend. Unfortunately, of late, she has been seen by many as out of touch and just plain weird and her Instagram account will only make that seem truer. Including odd photos of herself, strange paintings, images of a younger her kissing herself, the only normalcy present is photos of her alongside her kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bj-rk><strong>Björk</strong></h2><p>The definition of an artist, <a href=#>Björk</a> has been putting out distinctive and long-lasting music since she started her career in music four decades ago. All the more impressive due to the fact that she is fifty-one years old, something that is hard to believe based on her youthful face, over that time, she has proved herself capable of breaking ground over and over. In fact, Deadspin named her "the best non-pop female vocalist of the last 30 years," VH1 ranked her the twenty-ninth greatest woman in music and MTV called her the eighth “greatest voice in music.”</p><p>All of those accomplishments aside, she continues to push the threshold including on Instagram where she has uploaded several photos of a new look. Sporting facial masks that transform her look, in some of them she looks like something out of Stranger Things while in others, she comes across like a nymph. In a nutshell,&nbsp;she comes across as intense and creepy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kanye-west><strong>Kanye West</strong></h2><p>There is no doubt about it.&nbsp;<a href=#>Kanye West</a> is one of the strangest celebrities out there. Extremely egotistical, he considers himself one of the greatest artists of his era and judging by his success in the music industry, he may have a point. Unfortunately, the way in which he boasts about himself makes it near impossible at times to give him his due.</p><p>Also a fashion designer, he has worked with brands like Nike, Louis Vuitton, and A.P.C. while also creating his own lines like YEEZY shoes. If you judge the type of clothes he creates by his Instagram account, they may be pretty off-putting. Featuring a series of photos of his clothes but filtered in such a manner to look old and degraded, it may just be us but it brings to mind several Polaroids killers have taken of their victims. We think that due to the fact that the models featured seem to be purposefully stripped of their personalities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eric-andre><strong>Eric Andre</strong></h2><p>One of the edgiest people on this list, if you have only seen Eric Andre’s work as an actor, his other work in things like The Eric Andre Show would likely come as a shock. Also surprisingly adept at portraying the pal who may end up being a romantic interest in shows like 2 Broke Girls and Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, there is no way to predict his career trajectory. One thing we can assure you, however, is that his Instagram will be the home of some really messed up stuff. For instance, if you went to it at the time of this writing, you’ll find an image of R. Budd Dwyer about to kill himself, the actor Choi Min-sik eating an animal whole, and Hitler getting high.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=randy-quaid><strong>Randy Quaid</strong></h2><p>During much of <a href=#>Randy Quaid</a>’s career, there were few people in Hollywood more beloved than he was. Between his memorable performances in movies like Christmas Vacation, Quick Change, The Paper, Independence Day, and Kingpin, he crafted some of the most entertaining characters of the era. However, of late, he has become a lightning rod of controversy for his erratic behavior alongside his wife. Arrested several times in the last several years, there are several videos of him online ranting and raving as well as claiming that his life is in danger. When it comes to his Instagram, that holds true as there are a series of videos of him spouting off against what he sees as the corruption all around us.</p><h2 id=crispin-glover><strong>Crispin Glover</strong></h2><p>Most famous for playing Marty’s father in Back to the Future, <a href=#>Crispin Glover</a>'s performance in that film was pretty eccentric in scenes but pales in comparison to what he would go on to do. Also remembered by some for his wacky appearances on The David Letterman Show, that was but a window into some of the craziest things he has done in public. If you want to see the type of content he likes to make when left to his own devices, check out the movies he directed What Is It? and It Is Fine! Everything Is Fine. Both of which are not for the faint of heart. Or you could get a look at his mind by checking out his Instagram account that features photos of rooms, people, and the outdoors as if seen through a circus mirror.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=marilyn-manson><strong>Marilyn Manson</strong></h2><p>Prior to researching this list, if you had asked us to guess which celebrity might have the strangest social media account out there, chances are we would have said&nbsp;<a href=#>Marilyn Manson</a>. One of the most controversial people alive throughout much of the '90s, his extreme behavior on stage and in music videos was seen by many as a risk to North America’s youth. Even still, we were pretty taken aback when we saw the type of things that can be seen when you look him up on Instagram. Videos of blood dripping on a canvas, what is supposed to be a headless body, and footage of himself covered in black makeup while a white substance froths from his mouth, he sure is creepy beyond belief.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2Ysq2xwaxksKCfYr2wv9Nmq6GdXZi%2FprHPopysrF2owbayxWamp2WZo8C1rcarmKZn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-celebrities-who-went-broke-partying.html><span>←</span><span>15 Celebrities Who Went Broke Partying</span></a>
