Now, after coming for Samuels' marriage, the Season 6 preview looks like the cast is targeting Dr. Wendy Osefo's relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wendy is married to Eddie Osefo, a Maryland-based attorney. The Georgetown University Law graduate is the talk of Bravo, and Wendy isn't going to let the other women get away with petty gossip. Here's what we know so far about her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">relationship with Eddie.</a></p><h2 id=a-town-of-smoke-and-mirrors>'A Town Of Smoke And Mirrors'</h2><p>In the preview, we hear Wendy<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> introduce Potomac </a>off the bat as "a town of smoke and mirrors." What lies are the cast spreading, and about whom? For now, we see Gizelle Bryant stirring the pot by bringing up rumors about Eddie Osefo.</p><p>"What you're not going to do is you're not going to play with my husband's name," Wendy says as the camera quickly cuts to her making eye-to-eye contact with who we assume is Gizelle.</p><p>She's well aware of the power that a rumor holds. Well, what exactly are those rumors, and do they hold any truth? We're rooting for Wendy and Eddie, but whispers of infidelity are circulating drama blogs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;All About The Tea</a>, Eddie was warned by another husband of Potomac that rumors about his alleged child born out of wedlock would make airtime. The blog post stated:</p><p>"An in-law of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Wendy Osefo</strong></a> reached out to AllAboutTheTea.com ‚Äî giving insight into the beef between the couple and Eddie‚Äôs estranged parents. Eddie and his family will not kiss and make up. I have heard his family is even MORE mad at both him and <strong>Wendy</strong> for bringing their family issues to TV for a check. Reality TV is beneath them so they are pissed!‚Äù</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Fans Think 'RHOP' Has The Most 'Relatable' Cast</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The exclusive article further cited an anonymous source claiming that Eddie cheated on Wendy with a woman at his law firm. The source also threatened that their marriage woes will be included in Season 6, which the "First Look" also portrays.</p><h2 id=eddie-shuts-down-gossip>Eddie Shuts Down Gossip</h2><p>Eddie and Wendy are many viewers' favorite couple of the entire&nbsp;Real Housewives franchise. That being said, people who are jealous of a thriving relationship will spend all of their energy to take it down.</p><p>Back in May, Eddie shut down the rumors about his alleged secrete child in a heartwarming Instagram post dedicated to Wendy.</p><p>He captioned the Mother's Day photo, "It wouldn‚Äôt be your day without them; The mother of my ONLY 3 babies...Thank you for blessing me with my little chocolate üç´ drops üôèüèæ. The haters will always hate (misery loves company)..."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Plenty of Instagram posts of the happily married couple have been posted since then and before the smack talk emerged. He's not only honoring his marriage to avoid criticism. Before Wendy joined&nbsp;RHOP, Eddie wrote long love letters to her via social media.</p><p>In one post, in particular, he gratefully thanked Wendy for teaching him how to love and trusting him in loving her. He included, "Year 9 will definitely be one we write books about." Well, he's right but not in the way that these two probably expected.</p><p>We did, however, find one iffy thing on Eddie's social media. He only foll0ws a little over 600 accounts, but that's not what we noticed. While we initially scrolled through to see if he still followed the RHOP cast, we found that he follows a large amount of thirst trap Instagrams.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Reason Monique Samuels Left ‚ÄòRHOP‚Äô</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's not against the models who are building their personal brands. For many, it's also not a red flag for a husband to follow models/mature content accounts. This gray area topic is truly up to everyone to assess based on an individual set of relationship boundaries.</p><p>There's a lot of women in bikinis who Wendy doesn't mutually follow. An oversight on Instagram, however, is obviously a drastic difference from castmates alleging infidelity. They are not two in the same. We're still teaming with Wendy and Eddie!</p><h2 id=tension-with-eddie-s-family>Tension With Eddie's Family</h2><p>We've seen in the past how Eddie and Wendy have struggled with his family's acceptance of their relationship.&nbsp;Bravo fans analyzed the stressful rift on Reddit.</p><p>One fan posted to an&nbsp;RHOP Reddit thread regarding the impact of Nigerian culture:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Maybe because I‚Äôm Nigerian I used to think family estrangement was a problem more prevalent in our community. Untrue, as I‚Äôve gotten to know more non-Nigerians it doesn‚Äôt seem uncommon in any culture for families to cut off a member, sometimes for silly reasons, sometimes for serious issues, most too complicated for a TV show like Potomac to get into."</p><p>The layered backstory of Wendy's immigrated family and Eddie's family's beliefs involving heritage play a large role in the criticism of their marriage. We're not here to downplay those issues and commend Wendy and Eddie for navigating such a battle while honoring their commitment to one another.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'RHOP': Monique Samuels Claims Bravo Banned Her From Press Interviews</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipoaegYrWmvsSsZLCgkal6uLGMpKWor12Wr7DB02aunqaUrnqwv8SfpqxlmKrAo63NnWSenJSesm6%2B1Kamq6tf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hanna-beeei-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Hanna Beeei Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
