The phrase is a bit of a cliché, but there are times that it seems to ring true for Kate Beckinsale. In 2016, the actress was featured in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the hit period film&nbsp;</a>Love & Friendship...&nbsp;And ever since, the media has struggled to discover <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">which of Kate’s companions is her lover</a> and which are, well, her friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On one occasion, she hit a few Golden Globe parties with Machine Gun Kelly, leaving the press to speculate that the two were an item. Her response put overly eager gossip enthusiasts in their place: “Why don’t you worry about things that are actually happening... rather than waste your time on things that are not happening and never were and also get a f***ing life.” Way to go K!</p><p>If that wasn’t savage enough for you, there is also time the media tried to start a rumor that Kate was dating her best friend. Let’s take a look:</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate Beckinsale Hilariously Pleads For Vanilla Ice To Save 2020</a></span></p><h2 id=asking-kate-if-it-s-love-or-friendship>Asking Kate If It’s Love... Or Friendship?</h2><p>The drama got started when Kate hit up a casual basketball match with Stephen Simbari. She was spotted being quite cozy with her companion, as she watched the Los Angeles Lakers play. At&nbsp;one point, they held hands; at another sweet moment, Simon put an arm around Kate’s shoulders. But does a little bit of affection mean that there was something spicy going on between the two?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans seemed to think so. They inundated the actress with messages inquiring into the tabloid pics. The majority asked her if Stephen was her lover, although one fan wanted to know if he was her son.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate says, “absolutely not”</a> to both of the questions. The actress was quick to clarify that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen is her “gay best friend”</a> and also her assistant. Kate and Stephen are close enough to enjoy each other’s company and the occasional hug, but there is absolutely no romantic spark brewing between them.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate Beckinsale Uses Her Bra To Encourage Americans To Vote</a></span></p><h2 id=kate-voices-her-frustration-on-social-media>Kate Voices Her Frustration On Social Media</h2><p>As we know from the Machine Gun Kelly incident, Kate has very little patience for the folks who are procuring info about her personal life. Luckily for her prying fans, however, this time she didn’t leave any f-bombs on their Instagram comments. But that doesn’t mean that the actress remained silent about her frustrations with the ever-turning gossip mill.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In order to shut down the rumors, Kate added a photo of her basketball outing with Stephen to her social media: “Thank you @stephensimbari for making a slightly less gay face than usual so that we are now officially a tabloid couple. If I decide to defiantly flaunt our relationship again, you are no longer allowed to throw bits of sandwich at me.”</p><p>So, what is happening in Kate Beckinsale’s love life? At this time, the actress is keeping her lips sealed. As for any of our personal speculations, well, we will have to keep those to ourselves. After all, any guessing could lead to another one of Kate’s witty responses.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Is Kate Beckinsale’s Daughter Lily Mo Sheen?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaGjYra0edahpmajkamybq7EnKKipqOWuaZ50pqwrGWZqHqpsdFmmZ6rpGKzs7XEp5to</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./movie-stars-who-were-in-fargo-series.html><span>←</span><span>These Movie Stars Graced The Small Screen With Their Roles In Fargo</span></a>
