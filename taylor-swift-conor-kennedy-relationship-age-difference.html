Much of the credit for the singer-songwriter’s notoriety, however, is owed to her dating life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/taylor-swift-and-conor-kennedy-strolling-on-the-beach.jpg><p>From controversial rockstar Matty Healy to film star and songwriter Joe Alwyn, <a href=#>Swift has had a string of pretty high-profile romances</a> in her decades-long career. Though the ‘Blank Space’ singer’s romances almost always end up mired in controversy, none has raised quite as many eyebrows as her months-long romance with Conor Kennedy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Rumors that the two were an item started swirling in late July 2012 </strong>when Swift, then 22, was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted packing some serious PDA with Conor </a>in Massachusetts, <strong>barely a week after the Kennedy heir turned 18</strong>. "Conor put his arm around Taylor, and they kissed behind the boat shed," an eyewitness told US Weekly at the time.</p><p>A week later, news outlets confirmed that the two were officially dating, marking the start of a social media controversy that’s yet to die down. Despite the two having called it quits over a decade ago, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">X users were still slamming Swift for the relationship</a> as recently as May 2024</strong>.</p><p>“I just realized that not only did Taylor swift start dating 18yo Conor Kennedy when she was 22, but it was ALSO like, not even a month after his mother committed suicide??? Wtf,” one fan wrote on X in May 2024.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/does-taylor-swift-get-along-with-bradley-cooper-years-after-he-rejected-her1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift's Relationship With Bradley Cooper Changed After He Rejected Her Advances">Taylor Swift's Relationship With Bradley Cooper Changed After He Rejected Her Advances</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's relationship with Bradley Cooper is drastically different these days.</p><p>The months-long relationship was also the subject of an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">intense debate on Reddit in February 2024</a>, and yet again, fans were concerned about the duo’s age difference at the time.</p><p>“[I don’t care] what anyone says this is weird. A 22 [year] old and a just turned 18 [year] old? I'm 21 and would not date someone still in school. It's just strange. I don't think it's necessarily [wrong] but if someone I knew did it I'd think they were weird.”</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-raised-brows-after-purchasing-a-4-9-million-mansion-next-door-to-conor-kennedy>Taylor Swift Raised Brows After Purchasing A $4.9 Million Mansion Next Door To Conor Kennedy</h2><p>But it wasn’t just the age difference between Kennedy and Swift that raised eyebrows. Swift also found herself on the wrong side of public opinion when <strong>she reportedly bought a $4.9 million mansion right across the street from Kennedy’s grandmother</strong>, Ethel, mere weeks into the relationship.</p><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And it wasn’t just fans who were baffled by Swift’s grand gesture. According to J. Randy Taraborrelli’s ‘The Kennedy Heirs’, <strong>Conor wasn’t particularly thrilled with the purchase either</strong>.</p><p>“Conor liked Taylor, don’t get me wrong,” Conor’s friend shared in the book, “but this business of her buying the house on the Cape made him nervous. It seemed as if she was getting a little too attached, spending five million bucks on a house just to be near the guy.”</p><p>The two ignited even more controversy mere weeks later when reports surfaced that <strong>Swift had “kidnapped” Kennedy from his private boarding school in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts</strong>, whisking him off to Nashville on a private jet—all without his parents' knowledge.</p><p>An anonymous insider revealed to PageSix:</p><p>“Taylor missed Conor so much, she sent a plane for him a few days later. He’s been with her ever since, and his family doesn’t know when he will be back. Things have become so serious between them so fast that no one in Hyannis Port would be surprised if they eloped.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:11</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/taylor-swift-s-controvertial-private-jets-and-their-lavish-insides-are-kept-secret-from-her-fans1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift's Controversial Private Jets And Their Lavish Insides Are Kept Secret From Her Fans">Taylor Swift's Controversial Private Jets And Their Lavish Insides Are Kept Secret From Her Fans</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift doesn't talk much about her controversial private jet travel which is why fans are curious about the plane she regularly flies in.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift commented on the allegation </a>months later in an interview with RollingStone:</p><p>“How did I kidnap him?

This time, <strong><a href=#>Swift had allegedly crashed Kyle Kennedy and Liam Kerr’s wedding</a> at the Fairmont Copley Plaza hotel </strong>and had to be ousted not once, but twice by Kyle’s mother, Victoria Gifford Kennedy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/conor-kennedy-attending-the-daily-front-row-fashion-media-awards.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Victoria confirmed the news to the Boston Herald just days later:</p><p>“They texted me an hour before the wedding and asked if they could come. I responded with a very clear, ‘Please do not come.’ They came anyway. I personally went up to Ms. Swift, whose entrance distracted the entire event, politely introduced myself to her, and asked her as nicely as I could to leave. It was like talking to a ghost.
