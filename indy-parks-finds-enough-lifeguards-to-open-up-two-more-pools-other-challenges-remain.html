So far, it's opened seven, though Indy Island at Raymond Park was forced to temporarily close last week because of a maintenance issue.</p><p>"It's been a struggle. It's been stressful," said Donnie Massing, an Indy Parks aquatics supervisor.</p><p>But raising lifeguard pay to $13 an hour and adding recruiting bonuses has helped.</p><p>"We have crossed the red zone. We were really worried we wouldn't have enough to open," said Kimberly Campbell, deputy director of parks.</p><img loading=eager src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.tegna-media.com/assets/WTHR/images/22473a51-67d0-4149-8e0c-5e2787a72a71/22473a51-67d0-4149-8e0c-5e2787a72a71_16x9.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img loading=eager src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.tegna-media.com/assets/WTHR/images/22473a51-67d0-4149-8e0c-5e2787a72a71/22473a51-67d0-4149-8e0c-5e2787a72a71_1140x641.jpg alt onload="this.style.opacity=1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Indy Parks recently trained and hired enough lifeguards to open up at least one, if not two, more pools on that list of ten released in March. Krannert, Brookside and Northwestway are among the options, but no word yet on which will open and how soon.</p><p>Other changes are helping Indy Parks accommodate more people. Capacity limits were lifted last week, meaning pools are now able to operate at 100 percent capacity. Pools no longer need to shut down mid-day for additional COVID cleaning on top of the cleaning measures already in place.</p><p>Given some recent issues with the Indy.gov website, Campbell said the best way to get updates on which pools are open and hours of operation is to call 317-327-PARK or go to <a href=#>Indy Park's Facebook page</a>.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uMDHq2Wcp51krrPAyJyjnmecnrOme8WapKKkqWS2r7DYZqeaqpuoeqe1zZ2qZp2epMKotIyloJ%2Bdl6qus7DSZquoZZ%2Blsq951Klkra%2BfYrqwvsRmp6innKh6sMDHnqlmm5iWua2xzaCcrGWimrqitc1obGxpXZuCpLKTamybZWCWsHJ5k52bbmVoaLGleZSfZ3CbZJuveIXBag%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-old-is-tyler-story-meet-trevor-story-brother-on-instagram-257883-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Old Is Tyler Story?
