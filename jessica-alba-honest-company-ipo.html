In other words, The Honest Company uses "honest" ingredients and materials; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">organic</a> and eco-friendly.</p><p>After a prosperous nine years period, an official announcement was made, revealing that the actress had&nbsp;filed for an IPO for The Honest Company. This means that Jessica will from now on be offering shares of the company to the public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This decision came as a result of a particularly lucrative year, driven by&nbsp;a "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pandemic-driven surge in demand for baby products, lotions and sanitizers</a>". The Honest Company can credit its success to its efficient website, where one can buy organic products and sign up for a monthly subscription for regular supplies.</p><p>The actress's company profited from about 28% increase in revenue to $300 million for the year, with diapers and wipes representing approximately two-thirds of the total sales.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Consequently, The Honest Company&nbsp;will have its&nbsp;shares listed on the&nbsp;Nasdaq under the symbol “HNST". The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Californian</a> business has reportedly&nbsp;said to have plan to&nbsp;use the proceeds from the offering to fund marketing and direct-to-consumer advertising. Additionally, it will launch new products and buy complementary businesses.</p><p>With prominent underwriters for the offering, such as Morgan Stanley, Jefferies and J.P. Morgan, Jessica Alba's company and its move to list its shares is part of a bigger plan, which will see its online business strengthen. Furthermore, it also intends to boosts its&nbsp;presence at third-party sellers and in international markets, including in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Asian</a> countries.</p><p>Despite the company's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hiccup</a> back in 2017, where the enterprise saw its baby wipes recalled voluntary due to a reported ingredient-labelling issue, and a lawsuit settlement costing the LA-based company a significant sum, it preserved its status as a "unicorn company".</p><p>Indeed, in January, Bloomberg News reported that Alba's company could seek&nbsp;a valuation of about $2 billion in an IPO, with the enterprise&nbsp;valued&nbsp;$1 billion as of October 2017.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Read Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Official 10 Youngest Billionaires For 2021</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Just Jared</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3pr%2FSopqaZZGhr6J5x6ilnqukYrCwuc%2BapbJlmaW8cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jenna-ruggiero.html><span>←</span><span>Jenna Ruggiero</span></a>
