No matter how many ups and downs you experience, you will never lose your cheerful and tolerant perspective. Your inner nature is expansive, idealistic, and spiritually inclined.</p><p>Having a Cancer Sun Sagittarius Moon, you have had many dreams and lofty ambitions in your lifetime. And with your high standards, you are never content to settle for less. Narrowing down your ambitions can be difficult, since your vision is so broad. You can almost lose yourself in contemplating all the wonderful things you could do; the problem is in deciding on one.</p><p>As an individual with a Cancer Sun Sagittarius Moon, there are two sides to your nature. The Cancer personality has a strong need for security in a home or a vocation, but the Sagittarius inner soul longs for freedom, adventure, and romance. Although, after much experimentation, you may finally opt for a conventional career, you will never fully shake off that longing adventure. Because of this, you will often experience capricious moods that undermine your efforts. Whenever you feel overburdened with work or responsibility or drudgery, the temptation to drift off into exotic daydreams can be overwhelming. How many times have you suddenly dropped what you were doing in order to follow some romantic whim?</p><p>Having a Cancer Sun Sagittarius Moon, instead of surrendering to impulse and possibly abandoning responsibility, structure your activities and make sure you set aside plenty of time for travel, thought, music—anything that fulfills your need for escape and adventure. Give your soul a chance to take flight now and then.</p><p>With a Cancer Sun Sagittarius Moon, you are known for your candor, you are never afraid to speak your mind. Your likes and dislike are often based on gut reaction, as you are essentially an emotional person. With your emotions in charge, you often say things that you later regret. You must learn to cultivate a little tact or you will lose many friends.</p><p>Outgoing, trusting, and enthusiastic in your social relations, you seem carefree and easygoing; yet you are actually a lot deeper than most people realize. Philosophically inclined, you love to explore new ideas and, never content with the superficial, you prefer to probe deeply into the meaning of things.</p><p>If you’re an individual with a Cancer Sun Sagittarius Moon, when in love, you are trustworthy and loyal, but you do have difficulty focusing your affections. Since you crave experience and variety, you can easily become bored with just one partner. If you do settle down, you may find yourself continually thinking back on your many past affairs. But you do respect your partner’s freedom, and as a lover you are tolerant, affectionate and generous.</p><h3>Keywords For A Cancer Sun Sagittarius Moon:</h3><p>Traditional yet progressive; reserved yet talkative; kind; idealistic;&nbsp;intuitive; imaginative; colorful; restless; changeable; the romantic traveler; careful&nbsp;yet adventurous; dramatic; emotional volatility; an ear for music; an eye for patterns and harmony; a love of beauty.&nbsp;</p><h2>Pisces Rising</h2><p>If you were born with Pisces Rising, you carry within yourself a strong artistic gift that must sooner or later find expression. You have an active fantasy life and a pronounced romantic outlook. You want life to be perfect and since it isn’t, you choose not to see what you don’t want to see.</p><p>Down deep, many Pisces Rising individuals believe that they alone are destined to suffer disillusionment in life; sometimes others sense this secret sorrow in you. Often you feel you were born at the wrong time in the wrong place, and you are strongly drawn to the past.</p><p>Basically, with Pisces Rising, you have a dauntless goodwill toward others. You tend to be very sociable, fond of entertaining, and enjoy the warmth of companionship. You love the good life—fine food and drink especially, beautiful clothes, and travel. At parties Pisces Rising individuals are vivacious and verbal (sometimes you talk too much); you enjoy performing in front of a group. A talent for mimicry makes many with Pisces Rising turn to the theater.</p><p>For the individual with Pisces Rising, the word sentimental comes to mind when describing you. Your tender feelings are easily moved by sad stories, lost animals, and unhappy human beings. Your personality is also changeable, at times moody and distressed. Worry and imagined fears overtake and sometimes overcome you.</p><p>Having Pisces Rising, in your private life you tend to be disorganized, a bit careless, the kind who is forever losing or misplacing belongings. In work, however, you are knowledgeable and creative and can be quite disciplined when working within a group, especially in artistic projects. You are also successful in occupations that involve writing and travel.</p><p>Many Pisces Rising individuals frequently change their residence. It often happens with Pisces Rising that a person who was an adversary in early years becomes a valuable friend later on. You may sometimes have trouble with a first marriage because of in-laws and relatives. With Pisces Rising you are probably fond of children; your own children usually bring you pride and happiness.</p><p>If you have Pisces Rising, you tend to have large, luminous eyes and a sensuous mouth. You are likely to have wavy hair and well-shaped feet.</p><p>The planet Neptune, which rules Pisces, is very prominent in your birth chart. The influence of Neptune bestows compassion, sensitivity, keen intuition, imagination, creativity, and an interest in spiritual things and the occult. It also encourages confusion, indecisiveness, worry, vagueness, carelessness, and self-deception.</p><p>Uncover deeper insights into your personality, motivations, & desires with an <a href=#><span><strong>In-Depth Astrology & Numerology Natal Chart Analysis</strong></span></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tb7UpbCdoaaeu6Z6wqikaKulo3quu86nZpyZnpiys3nSrqVmr5mptW6%2FwKCgrayRp7a2v4ympqimXZa7pXnPoqqcnaNiv6q%2FyKee</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./breaking-bad-cast.html><span>←</span><span>Breaking Down The Breaking Bad Cast's Salaries Per Episode</span></a>
