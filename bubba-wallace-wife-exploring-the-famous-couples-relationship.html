The couple tied the knot on December 31st, 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>During the 2023 Daytona 500, most Toyota drivers ran rioting and leading the race. Unfortunately, that lasted until Bubba Wallace got bumped from behind and brushed the wall.&nbsp;</p><p>The incident killed his car’s momentum, and he dramatically dropped the order. At the time, he led the race, and the Toyotas were locked in a fierce battle with several Ford cars.</p><p>Bubba Wallace might not win the 2023 title, but it would be foolish to count him out.&nbsp;</p><p>The NASCAR star and his wife Amanda Carter first met when they were high school students: ‘I just remember seeing her, and I was like, ‘Wow, she’s beautiful,’ says Wallace.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the two have known eachother since high school, it was not love at first sight on Amanda’s side.<strong>“She thought I was nice, but not attractive,” </strong>Wallace, 29, told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a>.</p><p>At their first meeting, Wallace was a sophomore while Amanda was a freshman at the same school.</p><p>When asked about their high school days, Amanda said she did not remember how they met, but they were friends. Wallace always tried to take help from her during exams as she declared that she was much brighter than her other half.&nbsp;</p><p>The duo became close, but their <a href=#>relationship</a> didn’t turn romantic until later. Carter said it never worked out and never hit or landed in high school, and she even went to his prom with somebody else from his school.</p><p>After graduating high school, they talked once or twice a year until 2015, when they reconnected at a football game.</p><p>From there, they began spending more time together, and Wallace asked her to go to Las Vegas for one of his races when she was a senior in college.</p><p>Carter refused to go on this trip with him, hurting Wallace’s sentiments. Contrary to what Amanda thought, Wallace did not give up that easily.&nbsp;</p><p>He asked Amanda again a few more times, and eventually, she said yes. The couple started dating when they got out to Vegas.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Amanda, they started dating because they talked so much on that trip. They began to like each other.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Amanda Carter, and why is she famous?&nbsp;</h2><p>Amanda Carter was born on March 30, 1994, in North Carolina to parents Rebecca Carter and David Ryan Carter.</p><p>Carter is a senior financial analyst at the Bank of America in Charlotte. Previously, she worked for the Alpha phi international fraternity as vice president.</p><p>Amanda was featured prominently on Bubba’s Facebook docuseries Behind the Wall, and the Netflix docuseries on Wallace called RACE: Bubba Wallace.</p><p>Amanda has been a prominent part of Wallace’s life since 2016 because that’s when they started dating. The couple got engaged in 2021 and subsequently married in December 2022.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCu1JuZmmWnlrmtrcKeZLChlpp6psTPpaaroZ6cerW0xGadmqWfqsBur86up6Wdo2K%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1426544-bryan-danielson-nobody-in-the-aew-continental-classic-is-tougher-than-me.html><span>←</span><span>Bryan Danielson: Nobody In The AEW Continental Classic Is Tougher Than Me</span></a>
