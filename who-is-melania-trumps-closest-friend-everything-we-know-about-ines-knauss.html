For proof of that, look no further than the fact that even one of Melania’s former advisors wrote <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a tell-all book about working with her</a> which included some pretty salacious claims.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As is the case with all First Ladies, the media and Melania Trump’s followers have tried to learn everything they possibly can about her. Remarkably enough, however, even though Melania is married to one of the most outspoken people on the planet, she often opts to be very tight-lipped. As a result, most people only seem to know a few generalities about the First Lady.</p><p>Of course, Melania Trump is a human being just like the rest of us and people are social beings so it is safe to assume that she needs someone she can speak frankly with about her life. Thankfully for Melania, there is one person in her life that most people consider to be the First Lady’s best friend. Of course, for the rest of us that begs an obvious question, who is Melania Trump’s best friend, Ines Knaus?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Little Known Facts About Donald And Melania Trump's Marriage</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-first-lady-s-past>The First Lady’s Past</h2><p>Undeniably a striking person physically, Melania Trump began her modeling career at the age of 5 in her Slovenian homeland. Going on to make a name for herself in that industry, Melania’s career eventually took her to New York. Eventually able to meet Paolo Zampolli, the co-owner of a modeling agency, her new friend introduced Melania to his pal Donald Trump.</p><p>Said to have caught Donald Trump’s eye immediately, Melania began dating the businessman while he was still in the middle of divorcing Marla Maples. After getting engaged to Donald in 2004, Melania married the man the year after and she later gave birth to his youngest child, Barron Trump. Remaining by Donald’s side throughout his two runs for President, in 2000 and 2016, Melania became the First Lady after he won the office the second time around.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An Inside Look At Donald Trump And Tiger Woods’ Secret Friendship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scandals>Scandals</h2><p>Ever since it became clear that Donald Trump could become the President of the United States in 2016, Melania Trump’s life changed forever. For example, observers have read so much into the fact that at times Melania clearly doesn’t want to hold Donald’s hand that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">#FreeMelania has trended on social media</a>.</p><p>Of course, everyone makes mistakes and some of the scandals that Melania Trump has been involved in are more credible. For example, it was pretty hard to ignore the fact that Melania gave a speech at the RNC that obviously plagiarized a Michelle Obama DNC speech. That said, it seems like Melania’s speechwriter deserves the blame for that situation.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Melania Trump Is Trying To Promote Positive Social Media</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-ines-knauss>Who Is Ines Knauss?</h2><p>Long before Donald Trump became the President of the United States, he shared the spotlight he’d built for himself with several members of his family. For example, Trump has often appeared alongside his wife, and three of his children, Ivanka, Don Jr., and Eric, became a mainstay of his TV show, The Apprentice. On the other hand, many people continue to know very little about Melania Trump’s family and friends to this day.</p><p>As it turns out, one person in Melania Trump’s life is both a member of her family and an extremely close friend, her older sister Ines Knauss. Considered by many people to be the First Lady’s best friend and closest confidant, Melania and Ines are known to have spent a lot of time together when the Trumps still lived in New York. In fact, many have speculated that Melania’s controversial decision to continue living in New York for months after Donald moved to the White House was in part <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">inspired by her desire to remain near Ines</a>. Of course, that hasn’t been confirmed and it is extremely unlikely that it ever will be, but it does speak to how close the sisters and friends are.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Born and raised in Slovenia, Ines Knauss has always had her little sister’s back. For example, when they were still kids, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ines and her mother would sew together clothes that Melania designed</a> once she was old enough to sketch. Opting to move to New York at around the same time that Melania did, Ines currently lives in a $2 million Park Avenue apartment that is owned by the Trump Organization.</p><p>An artist, some of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ines Knauss’s work has been proudly posted on Melania Trump’s Twitter</a> page in the past. Said to be an extremely polite person, that hasn’t stopped Ines from being “fiercely protective” of Melania. For example, when some of Melania’s ex-boyfriends made public claims about the First Lady, Ines has come to her sister’s defense. That said, Ines has managed to continue leading a mostly private life even as Melania has become one of the most famous people in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Things Most People Don't Know About Melania Trump's Past</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuucSlmKehkWLBs8HMqapmm5ykwKa%2F02adq6GVo7FusdWeqbKsmJ67qHnWnmSkpp%2BseqKuzq6rZqGemsBut82arKyrXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-evelyn-yang-andrew-yangs-wife-bio-age-wiki-children-husband-and-net-worth-2.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Evelyn Yang?
