Many people have questioned what’s wrong with me and what has physically occurred to me. I was diagnosed withh bladder cancer in November. I sought surgery and medical care at Yale University Medical Center. I have no bladder cancer as of right now. That’s excellent <a href=#>news</a>, I guess. Then in March, I had a bad neck, so I had an MRI. We then discovered a Merkel cell tumour, a rare type of skin cancer, in my left neck. At the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Bradshaw claimed to have undergone surgery to remove it.’</strong></p><p>According to the Mayo Clinic, Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare kind of skin cancer that typically manifests as a flesh-colored or bluish-red nodule, frequently on your face, head, or neck.&nbsp;</p><p>Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin is also called Merkel cell cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>This particular type of cancer most frequently arises in older persons and tends to grow swiftly and spread quickly to other sections of your body.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether or not Merkel cell carcinoma has metastasized outside of the skin frequently affects the treatment choices available.&nbsp;</p><p>He gave an explanation for why his neck appeared fat in a Facebook Live conversation three days ago and mentioned that his first follow-up appointments are in about 40 days.</p><p><strong>I’m not going to die because the cancers are not present.’</strong> Bradshaw commented on facial edema; a component of the remedy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>‘This side of my face is largely numb, and it keeps the fluid in my face and jaw. It’s sluggish, coming, and going to take some time. But I’m completely okay. I may not&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>appear to be in great shape, but I am. That settles the matter, then.’</strong></p><p>Bradshaw, now 74, claimed that since last November, he has been battling two distinct cancers. He clarified that he decided to publicize it in response to inquiries about his on-air persona.</p><p><strong>‘People, even if I don’t feel like my former self, I still look like myself,’</strong> Bradshaw said.<strong> ‘I don’t have cancer. I feel fantastic. And eventually, I’ll return to what I was. Im blessed to have your love and prayers.’</strong></p><p>Bradshaw, a former player for the Pittsburgh Steelers and four-time Super Bowl victor who has spent a lot of time in the DFW/Oklahoma region, also revealed that a tumor was discovered on the left side of his neck in March.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bradshaw’s Struggle With Depression</h2><p>Bradshaw has previously spoken openly about his struggle with depression.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>‘My lungs were affected from the surgery,’ </strong>Bradshaw said. ‘<strong>A nerve was stopped, and what is currently happening is asthma, which makes life difficult for me in California. Although I’ve been dealing with a lot, I don’t like to talk about it or say.’</strong></p><p>His Fox coworkers showed their love, support, and appreciation, but Michael Strahan cracked a joke.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDAxKupsmWSp66lv8earmaglZa5tbSO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./teofimo-lopez-loses-his-lightweight-title-to-underdog-george-kambosos-jr.html><span>←</span><span>Teofimo Lopez Loses His Lightweight Title To Underdog George Kambosos Jr.</span></a>
