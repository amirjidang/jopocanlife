But as we all know, there is no such thing as a “good girl,” especially when it comes to the country music industry. Either you are a Miranda Lambert, or you’re a Miranda Lambert. Carrie can’t pretend that she wants to smash her ex-boyfriend’s car windows one moment and then pretend that she’s just another girl next door the next.</p><p>Of course, there’s a lot about Carrie that we simply don’t know. She just reveals want she wants to reveal in public, while keeping the rest well hidden and behind closed doors. There are so many reports about her&nbsp;controversial behavior that we are getting the feeling that she’s not telling us the entire story. Sorry Carrie, but you can’t have your cake and eat it, too. There’s a price that comes with the level of success that you have. After all, everyone knows that being nice in the celebrity world will only get you so far. With that being said, here are 20 ways Carrie Underwood might have ruined her nice girl image.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=those-breakup-rumors><strong>Those Breakup Rumors</strong></h2><p>Carrie Underwood and her husband Mike Fisher want us to believe that their marriage is rock solid, or at least it’s rock solid on social media. According to them, things are peachy keen and perfect. Yet Mike reacted a little too fast when a fan suggested that the break up rumors about them in the media were true. He was very quick to put the kabob on the rumors.</p><p>According to Fox News, he wrote, “That's not media. We've never been better. Thanks." The site reports, “The Instagram interaction comes after Fisher posted a spiritual photo of a sunset over a lake with a quote from Psalm 139:23-24 which read, "Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way of everlasting."</p><h2 id=the-evangelical-backlash><strong>The Evangelical Backlash</strong></h2><p>Carrie Underwood wants to be a good girl in the country music industry but she’s having a hard time keeping her fanbase happy. Last year she ruffled some feathers when she faced a backlash after her performance at an evangelical event. That’s because her fans there weren’t too happy over her support for gay marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Her concert was heavily criticized by the Christian nonprofit organization, American Family Association. They even went as far as questioning her presence at the event. Yikes. You’d think that Carrie would have something to say about this, but she didn’t.</strong></p><p>She didn’t defend her opinion or stance on marriage equality.&nbsp; According to Radar Online, “In an open letter to Atlanta pastor Louie Giglio, who founded the event in 1997, American Family Association's outreach director Wesley Wildmon questioned the country superstar's presence because of Underwood's public stance in support of gay marriage.”</p><h2 id=is-she-cold-hearted><strong>Is She Cold-Hearted?</strong></h2><p>Now, there’s no denying that when you are an entertainer in the public spotlight, you are going to have your moments. You’re not going to want to sign every autograph or pose for every photo. We get it.</p><p><strong>Everyone has their good days and their bad days. But that’s no excuse to act like a diva in public, right?</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the gossip blog Oh No They Didn’t, Carrie wasn’t on her best behavior. One person wrote, “My friend works as a DJ at a country radio station. She recently told me the following story about her encounter with Carrie Underwood. Yeah, just real arrogant and like she couldn't be bothered talking to anyone. She gets done reading the liners...LOOKS PAST ME up to the next person from a station also from Wisconsin and says, "Next." Are you kidding me? Next? No, good luck to your station. No, thanks for doing this." This definitely contradicts the image that people have of Carrie.</p><h2 id=she-s-not-an-all-american-girl><strong>She’s Not An All American Girl</strong></h2><p>I mean, if you are going to be a country bad girl, you might as well own it. There’s no point in pretending to be one person in front of the cameras and another person behind closed doors. Oh, wait. That’s basically everybody in the entertainment industry these days. Who are we even kidding? Apparently, Carrie Underwood acts like a diva and a snot in front of other celebrities, too. She apparently has a lack of respect for others and quite frankly doesn’t care what you think about it, either. According to The Talko, “An example of this is when Carrie told Leighton Meester before presenting to “get out there and don’t&nbsp;[mess]&nbsp;up” at the CMA awards in 2010.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>When confronted about what she said, Carrie replied, “She’ll get over it.”</strong></p><p>This isn't the sweetheart we all came to love!</p><h2 id=she-has-a-whole-different-side-to-her><strong>She Has A Whole Different Side To Her</strong></h2><p>If you think Carrie Underwood is a bubblegum country music artist who sometimes likes to take her frustration out on her ex boyfriends in the form of her song lyrics, think again. There’s another side of her that people have no idea about. And it’s one that she’s managed to keep pretty well hidden, too. In an interview with The Orange Country Register, Carrie admits, “I have a dark side. Yes, it is evil. I can be very moodi.” Well, according to the fans that have had their encounters with you, we definitely believe it.</p><p><strong>You’d think that she would do a better job of masking her emotions in public, but perhaps it will take her a few more years to learn what to say and not to say.</strong></p><p>Her fans might appreciate her more if she does a better job of hiding this moody side of her personality.</p><h2 id=there-are-too-many-expectations><strong>There Are Too Many Expectations</strong></h2><p>We get it. Being a country music star is stressful, no matter how much money you make or how much you end up performing each year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Carrie says that one of the reasons why she gets so frustrated with the industry is because there are just way too many expectations on female artists. That’s why she sometimes feels like just throwing in the towel, even though she can’t.</strong></p><p>According to Brainy Quotes, she once said in an interview, “It seems women are expected to be so much more than men, which means we have to work that much harder. We're the ones under the microscope. We're expected to sound perfect. We're expected to look perfect all the time. We're expected to be style-setters, whereas the boys roll onto the stage in their jeans, T-shirts and baseball caps.”</p><h2 id=she-knows-people-are-talking-about-her><strong>She Knows People Are Talking About Her</strong></h2><p>A lot of artists that are in Carrie Underwood’s position try to cancel out all of the background noise. I mean, there’s only so much pressure, frustration, stress and anxiety one can take, right? But not Carrie. She knows that people are talking about her and she wants to read about each and every last rumor. A lot of celebrities would say that doing so is not good for your mental health. But not Carrie. She is determined to always set the record straight, especially when it comes to her reputation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Brainy Quotes, she has said, “I've heard all kinds of crazy rumors about myself. I've even heard that I'm pregnant! I've become real good about laughing things off – I figure I'd better get used to it.”</p><h2 id=her-critics-won-t-go-away><strong>Her Critics Won't Go Away</strong></h2><p>Sure, we’ve heard this so many times in the past: haters are going to hate. When you are a huge country star like Carrie Underwood, you are going to have the same amount of fans as you do critics. There’s just no working your way around it. And thankfully for Carrie, it’s a fact that she’s learned to accept. After all, you can only pretend to be nice for so long, right? The mask is going to come off one way or another and for Carrie, it’s been slowly but surely slipping away.</p><p>According to Brainy Quotes, she had this to say in an interview a few years back: “I've learned this, that haters wanna hate. You could sing a song perfectly, you could write the songs perfectly, and some people are absolutely going to hate you.”</p><h2 id=her-idea-of-getting-revenge><strong>Her Idea Of Getting Revenge</strong></h2><p>Carrie Underwood has built her career on basically slamming her former love interests in her song lyrics. But then again, isn’t that what all country music stars do? Talking about their crappy love lives is basically part of their bread and butter. And Carrie is no different. She’s the kind of gal that will get her revenge on you, especially if she feels scorned. But apparently, Carrie doesn’t want her fans to think that she’s really like that in real life (uh huh).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Even though she once&nbsp;slashed a guy’s tires in a music video, she says she would never do that to one of her ex-boyfriends.</strong></p><p>Brainy Quotes has her saying this, “Getting revenge on a guy is just not worth it to me. I mean, it definitely sucks at the time, but obviously you're not supposed to be with that person.”</p><h2 id=her-post-accident-face-controversy><strong>Her&nbsp;Post-Accident Face Controversy</strong></h2><p>Carrie Underwood wants us to think that she’s a transparent kind of celebrity, but we are beginning to think otherwise. There was a lot of mystery surrounding her facial scars, surgery and the accident she had last year. She even went as far as having a “big reveal” at the ACM Awards and apparently, people weren’t having it.</p><p><strong>Many criticized her for making such a big deal about getting stitches on her face when in reality, some people have it much worse. They think she was blowing everything out of proportion.</strong></p><p>"It literally makes me sick that Carrie Underwood made such a big deal about her face needing stitches," one Twitter user wrote, according to Radar Online. "Maybe she should come visit my work where people face actual traumatic injuries that are life altering. #perspective."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-doesn-t-show-her-fans-enough><strong>She Doesn't Show Her Fans Enough&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>A lot of people think that Carrie Underwood acts&nbsp;a little too coy with her fans&nbsp;And no, we are not talking about showing off a little skin here and there on Instagram or frolicking in a tiny little bikini on the beach in front of the paparazzi. It’s the fact that she would wait so long before showing her face after her accident that got people a bit upset. They didn’t like it that she would share little photos here and there on Instagram, but from far away.</p><p>Gossip blog Celeb*tchy defended her actions by writing, “This is absolutely her prerogative to let us see what she wants, when she wants, and that accident must have been traumatizing without the added layer of her public image. Imagine being a famous person and then having a freak random accident which damages your face. Of course they have the added buffer of cosmetic surgery and the best makeup artists, but it’s still got to be difficult.”</p><h2 id=her-run-in-with-the-law><strong>Her Run-In With The&nbsp;Law</strong></h2><p>That’s right: Carrie Underwood actually had a run-in with the police. But no, it’s not what you think.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>The country star got pulled over for speeding, was eventually let go, but cried about the whole ordeal on social media. A lot of people think that she was doing this for attention and worse, for publicity.</strong></p><p>At the end of the day, a headline is a headline, right? But for some of her critics, the dramatics was a bit much. According to Radar Online, “The chief said Underwood was traveling southbound on Wilson Pike near the New Hope Church in the northeastern side of the city of Brentwood when an officer flashed his lights behind her at 10:21 a.m. Minutes after her embarrassing encounter with police, Underwood took to Twitter to speak of her shame.”</p><h2 id=she-gets-too-political><strong>She Gets Too Political</strong></h2><p>While it’s no doubt that a lot of country music stars have very strong opinions about the current political climate, Carrie Underwood likes to flip flop. Or at least, she likes to speak even when it’s not her turn.</p><p><strong>Back in 2106, the producers of the CMA awards asked Carrie and Brad Paisley to keep their political opinions to themselves while they were on stage, but they did it anyway. And it turned out to be a big flop.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Country Living, Carrie then “joked about the policy controversy. ‘Now, Brad, I don't know if you've heard about this, but the CMA has given us some 'guidelines' with specific topics to avoid," she said. "So we can't be doing any silly little songs because this year's show is a politics-free zone.’”</p><h2 id=she-feels-guilty-about-her-career><strong>She Feels Guilty About Her Career</strong></h2><p>Now that Carrie Underwood is a mom, she’s having a hard time trying to balance her professional life with her personal life. As a matter of fact, she’s even admitted to feeling guilty about her country music career. That’s because she often has to leave her son at home to perform on the road. And Carrie says that it’s not always easy.</p><p>She told Redbook back in 2017, “Ask for help. Accepting help is hard for me, but I’m learning. Sometimes I feel guilty that this is my son’s life: We live on a bus and we’re in a hotel room and sometimes we’re in the middle of nowhere and it’s not so great. It’s not all glamorous. We have a nanny who helps out, especially when we’re on the road. But I’d feel guilty asking someone to watch him at home while I run to the grocery store.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-onstage-persona-is-different-than-her-real-one><strong>Her Onstage Persona Is Different Than Her Real One</strong></h2><p>Carrie Underwood wants us to believe that her on stage persona is different than her real one. But hey, that’s something we’ve heard before, right?</p><p><strong>A lot of celebrities in Carrie’s position have said in the past that they are nothing like what you see on television or read in the magazines. But do we really believe it?</strong></p><p>She told Redbook magazine, “I love being onstage, but that’s different. That’s not Carrie. That’s Carrie Underwood. The rest of my life I feel like I’m incredibly disappointing to people. Like if I run into someone at the grocery store, I really don’t know what to say because I don’t have a microphone in my hand or bling on. They expect me to be ‘Carrie Underwood,’ but I’m just Carrie. I’m sorry!”</p><h2 id=dealing-with-online-backlash><strong>Dealing With Online&nbsp;Backlash</strong></h2><p>Let’s face it: online bullying is real and no one is immune to it. It doesn’t matter if you are a small town guy or gal or one of the biggest pop stars on the planet. Everyone gets bullied on social media. And Carrie Underwood is no different.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She told Redbook magazine in an interview, “I feel like bullies have changed the way I react to the world. You want to be connected to your fans, and I used to feel like I could go through social media and talk to people, really have that communication. But you get to a point where there are too many mean people saying mean things— probably just to get a reaction from you—and eventually I was like, 'I don’t know if I can do this.' You have to have a barrier up, which is sad.”</p><h2 id=she-doesn-t-like-love-songs><strong>She Doesn’t Like Love Songs</strong></h2><p>She might be a country music singer, but if there’s one thing that Carrie Underwood doesn’t like to do, it’s&nbsp;write country love songs. In fact, she would rather write anything but lyrics about her constant heartaches.</p><p>According to E! News, she said, “It’s a lot coming from me. I don’t do romance very well, at least not in my music. But I felt like when we were writing it, it was just so genuine and I think that’s one of my problems with love songs. It’s all like fairy tales and bubblegum and butterflies. That’s just not reality. I felt like as we were writing it, it was so conversational and this is my life. This is me and my husband just needing to be alone. It doesn’t have to be all presents and Romeo and Juliet. It can be simple and lovely.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-obsessed-with-her-image><strong>She’s Obsessed With Her Image</strong></h2><p>When you are constantly being criticized in the public eye, it shouldn’t come to a surprise to anyone that you are obsessed with your image. And it’s safe to say that Carrie Underwood falls in that category. Right after she gave birth to her son, it didn’t take her very long to start working out again, rather than spend time with her son at home.</p><p>She told Shape back in 2015, “After I had Isaiah, my goal was to take control of my body again. I was lucky: I gained only 30 pounds, which is the recommended amount, and I exercised throughout my pregnancy. I did have a C-section, which meant waiting six weeks before working out. Within 10 days, though, I was able to begin walking slowly on the treadmill and around my neighborhood. It felt so good to be active! When I got the OK from my doctor, I started exercising with my trainer. Now we box and we hike trails, among other things.”</p><h2 id=she-feels-like-she-has-to-work-hard-for-recognition><strong>She Feels Like She Has To Work Hard For Recognition</strong></h2><p>Even though her claim to fame was being on American Idol, Carrie has complained that she feels like she has to work twice as hard as her male counterparts in order to receive any recognition. Simply put, there’s a lot of disparity and she feels like female country singers are getting the shorter end of the stick in the industry. And for Carrie, it’s simply not fair, especially considering all of the work she puts in to her music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking about women in the country music genre, she told Cosmopolitan, “When I go to vote for the Country Music Awards, I have to write in names—I can think of, like, three who are really active. Women have to work harder to get half the recognition. I am one of the lucky ones.”</p><h2 id=her-supposed-marriage-difficulties><strong>Her Supposed Marriage Difficulties</strong></h2><p>When you are two very famous people in the public spotlight, it’s very hard to keep it all together. Carrie and her husband Mike have two lives: their personal ones and their public ones. And sometimes things can cross over, leading to some frustration and a whole lot of problems. Carrie finds herself defending her marriage and fighting off divorce rumors more than she has to. If things are so great, then why does she feel the need to tell people about it? That’s what inquiring minds want to know.</p><p>She told Cosmopolitan magazine, “Everyone is getting divorced. They’re dropping like flies! But we are good. It helped that we were both established before we were married. Neither one of us could be like, ‘I didn’t know it would be like this!’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhqYGLBqbXNoKpmmZKkwrV5wpqpq6GVYsKvsMSrrqinlGLBqa3TZqmuoZ5itaa%2BjKKkmp%2BVZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./20-candid-photos-of-90-day-fiances-darcey-silva-thatll-make-jesse-meester-miss-her.html><span>←</span><span>20 Candid Photos Of 90 Day Fianc's Darcey Silva (That'll Make Jesse Meester Miss Her)</span></a>
