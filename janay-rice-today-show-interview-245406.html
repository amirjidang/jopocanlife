The fact that I knew we wouldn’t be here anymore made me angry.”</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>Janay Rice Reveals A Detailed Account Of What Happened In The Elevator With Ray Rice</a></strong></p><p>Rice attested to the recorded incident being the only time the <a href=#>former Ravens running back</a> had ever hit her. Defending her own apology after the release of the footage, Rice pointed to her arrest as an indicator that she had some fault in the situation. She also remarked that her and her husband’s story has a “silver lining.”</p><p>“I feel like there’s a silver lining in all of this. I feel like God chose me and Ray for a reason, to bring awareness to what people are going through everyday. Even though it’s not what I’m going through everyday, it’s definitely brought this topic to the forefront. And we’re okay with that.”</p><p>Watch a clip from Janay Rice’s Today appearance in the video above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2Bur63YZqmim5ViwbCwwLJkrKCfrHqqutOeqa%2Bhlax6c4CUbWdvZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gaten-matarazzo-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Gaten Matarazzo Net Worth How Much is Matarazzo Worth?</span></a>
