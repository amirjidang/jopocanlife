And while we’ve seen <a href=#>more than three-dozen winners</a>, these folks aren’t necessarily the richest of the bunch. Their net worth is at least $1 million, minus taxes, of course. Or at least it was at one point.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Things That Were Totally Fake On Survivor</a></span></p><p>But some past players started out much richer anyway or at least became so after they appeared on the show. Some continued working in the entertainment business, others moved on to other industries where they found another way to earn their cool million (or more.)</p><p>With that said, here are 10 past players who all have a pretty healthy net worth, according to CelebrityNetWorth.com, despite all but two of them actually winning the show.</p><h2 id=richard-hatch---200-000><strong>Richard Hatch - $200,000</strong></h2><p>The very first Survivor winner in Survivor: Borneo, and only one of two former winners to make this list, Hatch’s earnings have taken a hit due to his legal troubles, which includes a conviction for tax evasion, after which he served three years in jail, followed by another nine months five years later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A <a href=#>notorious Survivor villain</a>, he returned to Survivor for All-Stars in 2003 and also appeared on The Celebrity Apprentice in 2011.</p><p>He has formerly worked as an auto salesman, real estate agent, bartender, and in-corporate training and consulting, while also serving in the United States Army. It’s unclear what he does today.</p><h2 id=elisabeth-hasselbeck---16-million><strong>Elisabeth Hasselbeck - $16 million</strong></h2><p>One of the most well-known past Survivor contestants, some even forget that she first appeared on the reality series under her maiden name of Filarski. After appearing on Survivor: The Australian Outback in 2001-02, where she placed fourth, Hasselbeck snagged an audition to replace Lisa Ling on The View, and the rest is history.</p><p>She remained the conservative voice on the daytime talk show panel for a decade, leaving in 2013 to co-host Fox & Friends. At the height of her career, she was bringing in a reported $3 million annually, which has contributed to much of her earnings.</p><p>She left Fox & Friends in 2015, stating that she wanted to spend more time with her family. She also has a line of gluten-free nutritional products under the NoGii brand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=candace-smith---1-5-million><strong>Candace Smith - $1.5 million</strong></h2><p>Playing a decade ago on Survivor: Tocantins in 2009, Smith was a former beauty queen, having won Miss Ohio USA in 2003, and competing in the Miss USA pageant in 2013.

It was he and his stepfather who finalized the deal to purchase the Miami Marlins, which moved the Expos to the U.S. and led to a lawsuit that was eventually thrown out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He was reportedly fired in 2017, and while it’s unclear what he’s up to today, he’ll likely remain one of the wealthiest former Survivor players ever.</p><h2 id=jimmy-johnson---40-million><strong>Jimmy Johnson - $40 million</strong></h2><p>A legendary former football coach then TV football analyst, Johnson began his career way back in 1965 as an assistant coach for Louisiana Tech University, then Oklahoma State University, and the University of Miami.
