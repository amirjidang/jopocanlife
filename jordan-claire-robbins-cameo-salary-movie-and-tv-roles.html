One of these sources is Cameo. Cameo is a website where anyone, majorly fans, can request and hire their favorite actors, athletes, or celebrities, to create personalized video messages for a fee.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Ten Highest-Paid Actors and Actresses of 2020, Ranked</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These videos can be used for several purposes, such as anniversaries, birthdays, holidays, and celebrating special occasions or people. For example, a fan can hire Jennifer Aniston, to send a personalized message to their spouse who is a huge fan of Jennifer. The celebrity sets the amount for the personalized message depending on how popular they are or how much demand is placed on their service.</p><p>A lot of influencers and celebrities are available for Cameo videos. The price range of a Cameo goes from as low as $1 to as high as $14,000, depending on the use of the video and the popularity of the celebrity.</p><h2 id=how-successful-is-jordan-claire-robbins-rsquo-cameo><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>How Successful Is Jordan Claire Robbins’ Cameo?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6c4ca93d-32bd-4a3f-ac31-a841aaf72ef0.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some suggest that Robbins makes more money from her Cameo appearances than from her acting roles. This is possible because she has a significant following on her social media platforms. She is also a sought-after performer and has a good track record. Robbins’ cameo is tagged highly responsive, with over 135 reviews, an average of 4.97 stars, and just one negative review. Robbins charged $35 per personalized video, $500 for a business video, and $186 for a live video.</p><p>Fans are also prompted to write reviews after they receive their videos, and they have lots of positive reviews to write about Robbins.</p><p>Here is an example of a review left by a fan on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robbins’ cameo</a>. She requested a personalized video for her daughter. The fan stated that Jordan completely exceeded her expectations. She said Jordan's cameo for her daughter was amazing, heartfelt, genuine, and insightful, and that listening to her words brought tears to her daughter's eyes. The fan encouraged others to book Jordan because she would not disappoint.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From her fans' reviews, we can see why Robbins is loved and quite popular on Cameo for making personalized videos.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-jordan-claire-robbins-make-from-her-cameo><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>How Much Does Jordan Claire Robbins Make From Her Cameo?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/c3069e8c-bb9e-4f64-8703-4f7a175c8bb6.jpeg><p>While there is no specific number, it has been speculated that Jordan has earned about $4,800 from making Cameo videos for her fans. Additionally, her recent appearance in movies has helped raise her profile and increase her popularity and demand in Cameo. It is however challenging to say the exact amount Robbins has made from Cameo as the website does not make it publicly accessible.</p><h2 id=jordan-claire-robbins-rsquo-other-sources-of-income><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jordan Claire Robbins’ Other Sources Of Income</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/0c76f857-5049-41f8-8463-706a9021a59a.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Robbins is a multitalented artist with many feathers in her hat, and can therefore boast of multiple sources of income. As a model, Robbins has had the honor of working with big-shot photographers. She has worked on campaigns for the likes of Dress to Kill Magazine, Sears, and Boutique Marie Claire. She has also been featured on the cover of dozens of magazines.</p><p>Robbins' earnings from her Television roles depend on the success, budget, and negotiation for the television series or movies. According to Salary.com, the average base salary is $60,201. Robbins has earned approximately $50,000 from her appearances in television series.</p><h2 id=the-biggest-factor-in-jordan-claire-robbins-rsquo-net-worth><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Biggest Factor In Jordan Claire Robbins’ Net-Worth</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/25734947-9523-448f-8668-c3c9c8e4c7a0.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Having established herself in the entertainment industry with her diverse roles and appearances, she is listed as one of the most famous television actresses.</p><p>Although Robbins' earnings have not been made public, speculation has been made about her net worth. According to Wikipedia, Forbes, and Business Insider, Jordan Claire Robbins' estimated net worth should be between $2 million to $5 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Life Love Lives Of The Umbrella Academy Cast</a></span>Her other talents such as producing, writing, modeling, and singing, has also contributed to her net worth. Still, a larger percentage of her earnings is owed to her career as an actress. We can infer that while her Cameo appearances contribute significantly to her net worth, Robbins makes more from her Television shows and movies. This does not negate the fact that she is one of the most popular and highly loved celebrities on Cameo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=where-does-jordan-claire-robbins-see-career-going><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Where Does Jordan Claire Robbins See Career Going?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/465d55d5-7fc0-49d1-a4d9-abce3f57d53f.jpeg><p>Additionally, in an interview with Authority Magazine, Robbins was asked where she sees herself heading from her current estate in her career. Robbins said, "I'm very focused on writing and producing at the moment. I still love acting and want to continue to do it, still, the idea of expanding into other ways of telling stories excites me, and the more projects I act on, the more I feel drawn to getting behind the camera and creating in these different ways. Especially since writing was my first love, I'm enjoying digging into that again, and I'm working on a few things I'm very excited about." So, we can probably expect Jordan to be behind the camera more in the coming days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Regardless of the amount Robbins earns, it is of no argument that she has successfully grown a fortune for herself from multiple streams of income which will continue to work for her for a long time to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKqUlrtur8uaoKudXae8o67Ip6pmm5GisrB50pqjmqqpYrqwwsieZJqmlGLBt3nRqKOeq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./demi-moores-dating-history-a-timeline-of-her-marriages-flings.html><span>←</span><span>Demi Moores Dating History: A Timeline of Her Marriages, Flings</span></a>
