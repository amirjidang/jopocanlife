Naturally, <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong></a> wasted no time called her out.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Following her appearance, the 47-year-old talk show host shared a comically edit of Hilton walking on stage to his Instagram page on Wednesday, January 26. “When you rush out of the house with the wrong shoes,” he captioned the image, setting the video to the popular TikTok track, “Oh No, Oh No, Oh No No No.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The Simple Life star immediately got in on the joke, dropping two laughing emojis and a fire emoji in the comments section.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Paris-Hilton-Accidentally-Wears-2-Different-Shoes-for-Tonight-Show-Starring-Jimmy-Fallon-2.jpg><p class=p1>While the whole thing was likely unintentional, fans are seemingly all about making the mistake into a trend. “They arguably still match though. The woman’s brilliant,” a user wrote, while another said, “Pretty sure this wasn’t an accident. But if it was —<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>her confidence is just goals. Sliving!”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“I saw Paris Hilton wear mis-matched heels, so I bought mis-matched heels,” someone else said, referencing the popular line from <i>Mean Girls</i>.</p><p class=p1>This isn’t the first time the This Is Paris star has had to deal with a wardrobe malfunction. Rewind the clock to 2020 and Hilton had a bit of a slip while en route to friend <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>’s birthday dinner in New York City.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Hilton, who wore a metallic cutout dress, ended up running into a problem with her slit, which was just a tad too high. While on her way into the party, the Paris in Love personality accidentally exposed her underwear to the crowd. She handled it like a pro though and smiled all the way through.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Five years prior she ran into a similar issue at a 2015 birthday party.
