Just ask former talent, Celeste Bonin, aka Kaitlyn, who left for a career in fitness apparel only to return on the indies and during the Mae Young Classic tournament.</p><p>It is safe to say that these former employees of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vince McMahon</a> are content working a different craft elsewhere these days, outside of the bright <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WWE</a> lights. We have former Divas making a living just about everywhere from a role as a nurse to a psychic medium.</p><p>Here are former <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Divas</a> making a living outside of the ring. Enjoy, let’s get started.</p><h2 id=alundra-blayze-performance-transition-coach><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Alundra Blayze – Performance/Transition Coach</span></h2><p>This might be the last thing we’d expect from a former WWE Hall Of Famer and Monster Truck driver.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nonetheless, Madusa is starting off fresh in a new field, recently launching an IG page dedicated to the craft as a performance coach. The role is meant to empower women – it seems to be the role of a life coach. She also recently launched her own podcast, supporting the new gig.</p><h2 id=ariel-makeup-amp-skincare-line><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Ariel – Makeup & Skincare Line</span></h2><p>When hardcore fans think of Ariel or Shelly Martinez, they’ll always link the former Diva to Batista and their backstage dispute which arguably led to her release.</p><p>She quietly transitioned out of the business, according to the former talent, she is retired from the ring. Ariel is keeping herself busy with a new line of skincare and makeup products – the line is against animal cruelty.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">7 Released WWE Stars That’ll Succeed Elsewhere (And 7 That’ll Return To WWE)</a></span></p><h2 id=cameron-fitness-app><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Cameron – Fitness App</span></h2><p>Former WWE star Cameron is keeping busy in the fitness industry. She recently launched her own app, DoubleAAcademy, which caters to fitness enthusiasts who are training from the comfort of their own home. Her timing really couldn’t be any better with the app.</p><p>Along with workouts, the app also comes with nutritional advice.</p><h2 id=amy-weber-luxury-real-estate><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Amy Weber – Luxury Real-Estate</span></h2><p>Weber’s wrestling days are far behind her - she’s a proud mom and realtor out in LA. However, she did recently make a splash on her YouTube channel, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claiming she was bullied by both Orton and Edge. </a>Now Randy doesn’t surprise us, but Edge certainly does. Here’s what she had to say;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was awoken by someone pouring a drink in my face. So immediately I popped up, I looked up, and I saw Edge, yes, you, Edge, with a partially drank drink in his hand.”</p><h2 id=summer-rae-go-herbalife-ambassador><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Summer Rae – Go Herbalife Ambassador</span></h2><p>Summer Rae had the tools to succeed during her time in WWE. The only problem, she was given the opportunity, as is the case with so many released talents.</p><p>She still attends conventions from time to time, though for the most part, she’s a brand ambassador and model for various companies. Among others, she recently signed a deal with Go Herbalife, a company selling health supplements.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eve-torres-head-instructor-of-women-s-self-defense-class><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Eve Torres – Head Instructor Of Women’s Self-Defense Class</span></h2><p>Some might argue that Torres retired way too young but in truth, that was the trend during the Divas era, as the talents got out in their early 30s and either branched off somewhere else or started a family.</p><p>Torres did both – she’s giving back nowadays as a proud self-defense coach for females. It is her goal to empower females around the world.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">8 WWE Divas We Want To See Return (And 8 That Need To Depart)</a></span></p><h2 id=joy-giovanni-medium><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Joy Giovanni – Medium</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps back in the Ruthless Aggression Era, few would have predicted that Joy would transition into a career as a psychic medium. Her run in the industry was a brief one, as part of the Diva Search and later, a run on SmackDown.</p><p>She puts on live events along with setting up private readings alongside clients.</p><h2 id=aksana-personal-trainer><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Aksana – Personal Trainer</span></h2><p>She entered the WWE world as a potential Divas Champion in the future, unfortunately, that never took shape for the talent.</p><p>Aksana entered the business as an established bodybuilder and once she left the company, she returned to her former craft as a personal trainer. She seems content in the role, a WWE or wrestling return is unlikely.</p><h2 id=dawn-marie-nurse><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Dawn Marie – Nurse</span></h2><p>A big applause to Dawn Marie for her service nowadays as a nurse. Given the current conditions, it takes a lot of bravery to take on such a role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dawn made a joke via her Twitter account that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she used to wear bikinis to work,</a> now she’s covered from head-to-toe given the precautions needed. Out of the hospital, Dawn is a proud mom of two children.</p><h2 id=vickie-guerrero-receptionist-podcast-host><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Vickie Guerrero – Receptionist/Podcast Host</span></h2><p>Vickie’s relationship with WWE took a bit of a hit following her AEW cameo. WWE has made it clear, they don’t want former stars appearing on the rival show.</p><p>Vickie is keeping busy these days with her own podcast, Excuse Me. How could it be called anything else? The podcast features&nbsp;a mix of things from discussing trending topics in the business to discussing matters alongside the likes of Taeler Hendrix.</p><h2 id=eva-marie-fitness-ambassador><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Eva Marie – Fitness Ambassador</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eva leaving WWE didn’t come as much of a surprise. Fans knew she was destined for success elsewhere, though the wrestling ring didn’t seem like her true calling.</p><p>Credit Eva, as she continues to succeed despite the WWE release, serving as a brand ambassador for multiple companies, including Reign Body Fuel. She has stated in the past that a return to WWE is something she is interested in.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">14 Eva Marie Workout Photos We Can’t Stop Looking At</a></span></p><h2 id=torrie-wilson-fittensity><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Torrie Wilson – Fittensity</span></h2><p>Wilson is all about the fitness way of life, recently launching her own website, Fittensity. Fans can take a quiz as soon as they enter the site, assessing with their current goals are.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wilson is also happily married, recently tying the knot, of course, along with her WWE Hall Of Fame induction. Given her current look, she could climb back in the ring tomorrow.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT –<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vince McMahon May Be Looking To Sell WWE To Disney</a></span></p><p>Sources – IG, Twitter & Wrestling Inc</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ2jmnqnu9GmnKtlp6yybrDIr5isZZGnsm66zrBkppmbnruoecBmo6KumaO0brvUraqinJVivKd506GcZqqZo7Rw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-sackler-saga-purdue-pharma-opioids-and-the-6-billion-dilemma.html><span>←</span><span>The Sackler Saga: Purdue Pharma, Opioids, And The $6 Billion Dilemma</span></a>
