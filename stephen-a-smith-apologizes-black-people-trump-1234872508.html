He asserted that the community misconstrued his words.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I’m fully aware that I have been&nbsp;in&nbsp;the news the last few days.&nbsp;Paraded&nbsp;all over social media as well after comments I made on&nbsp;Fox&nbsp;News’&nbsp;Hannity&nbsp;last week…A lot of folks in Black America seem pretty pissed at me right now,” he began. “Quite a few folks were offended as my words were interpreted as associating support for Trump by the Black community with all the legal issues he’s facing. For that, I sincerely apologize. I’m stating right here for the record that I was taken out of context.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As he continued, he asserted that the way he was depicted in the news was just as offensive. He then clarified what he&nbsp;was trying&nbsp;to say during his Fox News bit.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Smith stated that he has been reading the news&nbsp;of&nbsp;major&nbsp;publications and it has been reported that Trump is picking up&nbsp;major&nbsp;support from Black voters.&nbsp;He insisted he was merely stating facts previously reported by reputable American sources like the New York Times, Axios, and more.&nbsp;He&nbsp;also pointed out that Trump has&nbsp;taken the lead in&nbsp;all five major national polls. However, he&nbsp;still&nbsp;remained apologetic in his stance.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Why did I say all of that? Because I wanted to show you I didn’t just open my mouth. I read, I listened, and I’ve seen a momentum shift as we all have,” he added.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Anywhere I appear, no matter my subjectivity relating to what I&nbsp;feel,&nbsp;is still going to&nbsp;be based on facts being presented into the stratosphere. That is who I’ve always been. It is who I’ll always continue to be. But it’s never exercised with malice on my heart and certainly never to assault or harm the Black community, my community…Just because my intent was&nbsp;harmless,&nbsp;doesn’t mean my words will&nbsp;harm less, and I know that.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The talking head went viral in mid-April after his appearance on Hannity. There, he was asked about Black America’s relationship with Trump and what Black Trump supporters&nbsp;were&nbsp;feeling during his trial. Smith explained that they can<a href=#> relate to Trump “being discriminated against.” </a>The comments sparked an <a href=#>outcry from the Black community</a>, with the NAACP also voicing its disdain for Stephen A’s remarks.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Relatable!?!
