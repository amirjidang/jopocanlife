Surely not as many as Blake Lively.&nbsp;The actress has been promoting her upcoming film A Simple Favor for the past week, but over the weekend she kicked her looks into high gear.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The fashion plate began her parade of fun looks&nbsp;n a lovely polka-dotted Zimmerman frock on Saturday, April 28. It had classic lines but with also some twists— not only did the ruched bodice and sleeves give way to a deep V neckline, but there were also velvet straps forming a mock halter. And the A-line skirt? It was semi sheer. Ever the effortless style maven, Lively paired the outfit with her fashion mainstays: pink Christian Louboutin pumps&nbsp;and Lorraine Schwartz and Jacquie Aiche baubles. To complement her demure-but-not-boring&nbsp;vibes, the former Gossip Girl actress wore her signature flaxen strands in voluminous beachy waves and rocked a subtle smokey eye paired with a pink lip.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Lively then went on to rock a tiered floral Michael Kors frock, making light of her many looks for the day with the Instagram caption: “I only do movies to excuse absurd amounts of outfit changes per day…” To cap off&nbsp;her black, red and floral number (a statement, if we do say so ourselves) the mom of two wore PVC&nbsp;Christian Louboutin stilettos, added a leopard print belt (#PowerClash)&nbsp;and adorned her look with Anthropologie, Lola James and Jen Meyer jewels.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>And last but not least: for her third amazing outfit of the weekend, Lively wore the downtown cool-girl ensemble of our dreams.&nbsp;Her mixture of shades of gray and different fabrics gave her fitted blouse, tailored blazer and wide-leg pants Ralph Lauren&nbsp;situation so much visual interest. And&nbsp;Lively took things to another level with Christian Louboutin slides, Jacqui Aiche, Jen Meyer and Lorraine Schwartz. Finishing touch: a loose, thrown-together bun because Blake,&nbsp;she doesn’t ever look overdone.&nbsp;</span></p><p>There you have it: three killer looks, one killer fashion maven.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5e5orfEZqOirpWhxm7DxJqprGWknb%2BmsYydnKyhl6Oys3nOrqufoaSoerW7jKmpqKWfqbJurYysoKaonJp6p63VqKlo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tyler-mitchell-beyonce-vogue-portrait-for-vogue-gallery-museum-660010.html><span>←</span><span>Beyonce's 'Vogue' September Portrait To Be Acquired By Museum</span></a>
