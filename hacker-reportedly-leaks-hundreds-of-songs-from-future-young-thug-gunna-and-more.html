I’m 100% fitting to take my time out to find out 100% who exactly is leaking my music and I’m 100% gonna pull up to whatever studio it is and I’m 100% gon’ beat yo a**, on my mama,” he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans used the opportunity to troll and post a second list of leaked music under the initial list, claiming the songs were Drake leaks. Upon reading the song titles—mostly made up of social media jokes and obscene phrases aimed at the Toronto rapper—it became clear that was a joke.</p><p>This major haul comes just over a week after Latto faced a similar situation when 130 of her unreleased demos hit the internet. Though the “Big Energy” rapper was able to capitalize on being a trending topic, Coi Leray and BIA faced ghostwriting allegations due to reference tracks for “Blick Blick” and “Whole Lotta Money” being leaked as well.</p><p>The “London” artist cleared the air after a fan questioned if the Grammy nominee wrote for her, tweeting, saying “No London jae wrote the hook, I wrote the pre and verse it’s not rocket science.”</p><p>This will surely not be the last time artists get hacked and their music gets leaked. There is also a myriad of ways for artists to react, ranging from Young Nudy threatening violence to Latto refusing to engage in the controversy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b>MDLBeast Soundstorm 2022: Biggest Comeback Of All Time, Five Rap Legends Light Up The Big Beast Stage With DJ Khaled</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Vibe</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1oq%2FKnqlmqpWlvLPAxJ2jsmWcmq6sv4yhrKecopqxtHnOn2Ssp56cwG6y0aikZp6lqcKzsYyypq6ml2LBqcHGZp6upp6WeqK6w2akqKqVZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./denzel-washington-hannibal-criticism-tunisia-1234833967.html><span>←</span><span>Denzel Washington Hannibal Casting Sparks Criticism In Tunisia</span></a>
