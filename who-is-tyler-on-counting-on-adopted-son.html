<span>Kelle Repass</span></p><h1>The Truth About Tyler Hutchins</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Every family has its up and downs. TLC’s most famous family the Duggars on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">19 Kids And Counting and the 2015 spin-off Counting On</a> have faced several strange and traumatic events in their lives. For a family that claims to live by God's word, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they have an extensive background of arrests, sex scandals, and shady dealings</a>. Jim-Bob and Michelle Duggar’s latest challenge has been introducing their great-nephew, Tyler Hutchins to the rest of the family. The tween was taken in by Michelle and Jim-Bob Duggar after Hutchins’ mother Rachel was found “unfit” to care for the child after facing several criminal charges and felonies. Despite all that has transpired with Rachel Hutchins, Tyler has adjusted nicely into his expanded family. According to his great aunt and uncle, the 12-year-old loves his new life with his big family. Though the show <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Counting On predominately focuses on the older children of the Duggars</a>, Tyler Hutchins has made a few appearances here and there. We at TheThings have all the details on Counting On’s newest addition to the ever-expanding Duggar family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Locals Call Jed Duggar Unqualified, Uneducated, And 'Creepy' As Arkansas Election Approaches</a></span></p><h2 id=tyler-hutchins-was-adopted-by-his-aunt-amp-uncle>Tyler Hutchins Was Adopted By His Aunt & Uncle</h2><p>It can be difficult adjusting to new surroundings, especially for younger children who are put up for adoption by their parents. Tyler Hutchins had the misfortune of being given up for adoption by his mother Rachel Hutchins, who at the time was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">homeless and committed several felonies</a>. Additionally, Rachel gave birth to her son as a teenager. In 2015, her mother Carolyn looked after her son for some time, until she suffered a stroke. The grandmother’s health episode led Rachel to seek out assistance from her extended family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Michelle and Jim-Bob Duggar legally adopted Tyler in 2017 and treated him as though he were their own. The Duggars have given the 12-year-olds their family surname, making the transition official. No information has been released on whether or not Rachel Hutchins played a part in the changing of her son’s last name. Though, Hutchins seems to get treated as “the black sheep” of the family, given the fact that she doesn’t make frequent appearances on the show. The Hollywood Gossip reported that Rachel recently gave birth to another boy but the infant died shortly after. A funeral service was held for Rachel’s second son, which Tyler Duggar attended with his extended family. The 12-year-old has witnessed and endured way too many hardships.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Perez Hilton Reacts To Duggar Theft Scandal, After Jill Duggar Accuses Father Of Stealing</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tyler-hutchins-still-keeps-in-contact-with-his-mother>Tyler Hutchins Still Keeps In Contact With His Mother</h2><p>While it’s been difficult for Tyler Hutchins to adjust to life living with his extended family, staying in contact with his mother has made the transition smoother. Tyler Hutchins may have been legally adopted by the Duggars, but they allow the 12-year-old to see his mother. As the Duggars have a strong belief in familial ties, they weren’t opposed to granting Rachel scheduled visitations to see her son. Sources haven’t reported how often Rachel visits Tyler but we’re sure every meetup is full of love. Despite the fact that Rachel gave up her son to her extended family, the Duggars often receive checkups to make sure Tyler is good custody. Distractify reported that in 2018 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Duggar passed a welfare check with flying colors.</a> The report basically read that the Duggars were of both sound mind and health, to look after Tyler Hutchins. All in all, the report showed that the 9-year-old at the time was in good hands with the Duggars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Juicy Facts About Our Favorite Duggar, Jinger</a></span></p><h2 id=welcomed-with-open-arms>Welcomed With Open Arms</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TLC-Tyler-Hutchins-Monsters-Critics-resized--e1605068798639.jpg><p>Despite all the challenges Tyler has faced, Michelle and Jim-Bob Duggar make sure to shower their great-nephew with love. The parents of 19 kids have even now introduced Tyler as their 20th child on Counting On. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to InTouch Weekly</a>, the Duggars first introduced the 12-year-old on Facebook, then on their spin-off series back in 2018. Not only have Michelle and Jim-Bob Duggar officially welcomed Tyler into their family but so have the other younger children. Tyler is often seen alongside his partner-in-crime Jackson Duggar on the show, treating him as a “little brother.” How cute is that? Tyler even participates in the Duggar’s family activities, such as mission trips, and goes to Fort Rock Family Camp. Tyler Hutchins is a certified Duggar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As if the 12-year-old didn’t receive enough embarrassing “hugs and kisses” from his aunt and uncle, the Duggars often share sweet tributes to Tyler on his birthday. In 2017, Michelle and Jim-Bob Duggar shared a sweet post on Facebook in honor of his special day. “We are so glad to have you in our home and a part of our family! Your bright smile and sweet spirit brings much joy to us all! Jackson loves having a ‘little brother/cousin’ to ride bikes and play with and read your bibles together. Our prayer is that each day you will seek God’s will for your life and that God will use your life in a great way.” Tyler Hutchins clearly is surrounded by love from his relatives and cousins.</p><p>Hopefully, the child is just as happy on the show as the Duggar family claims. Tyler Hutchins has adjusted well to his new family and even made a few friends among his cousins. Likewise, the 12-year-old has been a gracious addition to the Duggar household.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Must-See Photos From Joe & Kendra Duggar’s Instagram</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuwNilnKtln6N6pLvUp6uippdivK95wJ2mqayVmXq0u81o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rhonj-the-truth-about-margaret-staub-and-danielle-staubs-friendship-today.html><span>←</span><span>The Truth About Margaret Josephs And Danielle Staubs Friendship Today</span></a>
