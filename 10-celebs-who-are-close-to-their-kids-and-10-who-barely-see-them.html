And if you had two parents who worked full-time, you probably remember that when they were really busy, it could be difficult to squeeze in a lot of family time. Yup, it seems like everyone’s schedules these days are crazier than ever—everyone always has a million things on their to do lists! But the truth is that good parents will always find a way to spend a little extra time with their kids. Even if those parents happen to be celebrities! Yup, there are some famous families that seem super close, despite the fact that the parents are always flying around the world to one movie set or another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, sometimes you find out that a certain celebrity has a kid, and you find yourself thinking, “Seriously?” Now, some celebs just make an effort to keep their kid out of the spotlight for privacy reasons, but that’s not what we’re talking about here. There are some celebs who just never seem to stick around in order to parent their kids. Here are 10 celeb parents who are super close with their kids, and 10 who barely see them.</p><h2 id=close-with-their-kids-drew-barrymore>Close With Their Kids: Drew Barrymore</h2><p>Drew Barrymore is no stranger to growing up in the spotlight—after all, she has been famous since she was a little girl. According to Hello Magazine, Drew is a member of the famous “Barrymore” family—in other words, her family has been well-known and wealthy in the entertainment industry for a few generations now. She made a name for herself as a child actress by appearing in blockbuster classic films like E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Perhaps Drew is so close to her own children because she had a troubled childhood, and does not want them to go through the same thing.</strong></p><p>According to People magazine, she married art consultant Will Kopelman in 2012, and together, they have two daughters, Olivia and Frankie. In 2016, People later reported that the couple was getting a divorce. However, Drew still puts family first, despite all of the obstacles. According to Forward, Drew says that she does her best every day to inspire her daughters to follow their dreams. She enjoys taking them to sets with her so they can see what she does on a day to day basis, and still get to enjoy plenty of time with her despite her crazy schedule.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=barely-sees-them-dj-pauly-d>Barely Sees Them: DJ Pauly D</h2><p>Here’s the thing—you might be surprised to hear that Pauly D from the hit reality TV show Jersey Shore really does love being a father. But according to MTV, he says that his daughter, Amabella, is the light of his life. And in fact, People even reported that Pauly has called Amabella his little mini-me! However, he does not see her very often, which is unfortunate. This is because Pauly is no longer dating Amabella’s mother. They split a few years ago, and Amabella’s mother has full custody. This arrangement just makes sense—after all, when Pauly is not filming the reboot of Jersey Shore or appearing on other reality shows, he is traveling around doing shows as a DJ.</p><p>It’s definitely sad that Pauly barely ever gets to see his daughter. However, you can’t just “have it all”—if he wants to continue with his current career and lifestyle, there are going to be trade-offs, and he may not be able to see his daughter as often as he likes. Perhaps in the future, when he is done doing the press rounds for the new season of Jersey Shore, he will get to spend some more time with her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=close-with-their-kids-jessica-simpson-and-eric-johnson>Close With Their Kids: Jessica Simpson And Eric Johnson</h2><p>Jessica Simpson used to rule the radio: you couldn’t turn the dial without hearing one of her hit singles, like “With You.” You may remember Jessica dating Nick Lachey at the height of her career back in the early 2000s, but the couple got married in 2002 and later divorced in 2006. She went on to date former NFL tight end Eric Johnson, and eventually they had two children together: their daughter, Maxwell, was born in 2012, and their son, Ace, was born in 2014. The couple officially got married shortly after Ace was born.</p><p><strong>It seems like Jessica made a good decision by waiting to have children with Eric rather than rushing into motherhood during her first marriage. Now, her little family is quite close, and although People has reported that she is currently working on an album, she has much more time to devote to her family.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Hello Giggles, her kids absolutely love dressing up, and sometimes, she even works out with them by her side! They are always posing for cute family photos together, and her kids are a constant fixture on her Instagram account. It seems everyone in the family is doing pretty well.</p><h2 id=barely-sees-them-michael-lohan>Barely Sees Them: Michael Lohan</h2><p>It’s no secret that Lindsay Lohan came from a troubled family background. You have probably heard all kinds of stories about how her mother, Dina Lohan, encouraged her partying and other destructive habits from a young age—according to MTV, Dina was not a positive influence on Lindsay, and Lindsay felt that her mother’s lifestyle and attitude contributed to some of her own issues. However, Lindsay has reconciled with her mother and definitely calmed down a lot in recent years. She has really gotten her life back on track, and according to E! Online, she will be returning to TV acting this year. Perhaps one reason she has been able to sort herself out is because she sadly had to cut off contact with her father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Lindsay’s tumultuous relationship with her mother has gotten a lot of press, but her relationship with her father was worse.</strong></p><p>Now, the two never see each other—according to Harper’s Bazaar, Lindsay stopped speaking to her father nearly ten years ago because she said that his behavior was highly unpredictable. She no longer wanted to deal with the conflicts between them, and she felt that there was simply no way to improve their relationship.</p><h2 id=close-with-their-kids-hilary-duff>Close With Their Kids: Hilary Duff</h2><p>We were all so excited when Hilary Duff became a mom. After all, it basically felt like she was everyone’s big sister when she was on the hit show Lizzie McGuire. So it just made sense that she would be a great mom! Hilary married former professional hockey player Mike Comrie back in 2010, but unfortunately, the couple ended up getting a divorce back in 2016. During their marriage, the couple did have one child together: their son Luca was born in 2012.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Right from the beginning, the couple announced on Twitter that they simply adored their son, and they already loved being parents. Even after they initially separated, they still intended to co-parent their son, but eventually, E! reported that Hilary had been awarded full custody of Luca.</strong></p><p>Now, it’s rare to see a photo of Hilary without Luca by her side. These two just seem to do everything together, and Luca is truly her little mini-me! According to the Daily Mail, Luca didn’t even realize Hilary was famous for a while, but now, he finds it so funny whenever he sees her face on TV or the cover of a magazine! She was definitely meant to be a mom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=barely-sees-them-tom-cruise>Barely Sees Them: Tom Cruise</h2><p>When Tom Cruise became a father, it was a huge deal. Katie Holmes gave birth to their baby girl, Suri, in April 2006, and the press went wild. After all, he was—and still is—one of the biggest stars in Hollywood. Naturally, people wanted to know all about the family. However, what looked like a happy family at first did not stay that way. Clearly, Tom and Katie (or TomKat, as they used to be called), were simply not meant to be, and the couple ended up getting a divorce. And shortly after, people began realizing that no one ever seemed to see Tom out and about with Suri anymore.</p><p><strong>According to In Touch, while the legal details of the couple’s divorce were kept very private, it’s clear that Katie ended up getting full custody of Suri. In fact, they reported that Tom would sometimes go up to four months without ever seeing his daughter!</strong></p><p>After the magazine published this, Tom became very angry and tried to sue them—but in the process, he ended up admitting that In Touch was correct, and he only saw his daughter a few times a year. It’s a shame how things turned out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=close-with-their-kids-gisele-bundchen-and-tom-brady>Close With Their Kids: Gisele Bundchen And Tom Brady</h2><p>We’re pretty sure that the term “power couple” was basically invented for Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen. Seriously, Gisele is basically the most famous and highly-paid supermodel on the planet, and Tom is one of the best quarterbacks of all time—and if you ask any Patriots fan, he’s THE best. Not only are they both amazing on their own, they also have two children: their daughter Vivian and their son Benjamin. Although Gisele and Tom are both incredibly busy, they do their best to take their kids along for the ride whenever possible!</p><p><strong>According to People, Gisele was not shy about keeping her babies behind the scenes with her at photoshoots—it was the perfect opportunity for her to spend time with them in the midst of a packed schedule.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Plus, Gisele’s Instagram proves that the kids absolutely love going to football games whenever their dad is playing! Gisele also shares photos of the family doing yoga together and playing outside—according to People, Gisele and Tom both feel that health is very important to their family, and they try to keep their kids on a primarily plant-based diet and help them stay as active as possible! How awesome!</p><h2 id=barely-sees-them-louis-tomlinson>Barely Sees Them: Louis Tomlinson</h2><p>When the news broke that Louis Tomlinson of One Direction was going to become a dad, fans everywhere felt their hearts break. But according to In Touch, Turns out that he wasn’t even dating the mother of his future child, Briana Jungwirth: he had gone on a few dates with her, and while they certainly liked each other, there was never anything too serious going on between them. Eventually, Louis and Briana went their separate ways, and according to the Daily Mail, Briana currently has full custody of their son, Freddie, due to Louis’s crazy recording and touring schedule.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>According to People, Louis says that he truly loves his son and enjoys being a father. He even says that he wants to have more children in the future. However, he has very limited time to spend with his son.</strong></p><p>This is unfortunate, but just like with Pauly D, this is just a consequence of his lifestyle. If he really does want to have more kids—and hopefully have the chance to be more involved in their lives—he will probably need to wait until he is ready to put his music career on the backburner for at least a little while.</p><h2 id=close-with-their-kids-kris-jenner>Close With Their Kids: Kris Jenner</h2><p>Alright, this one barely even needs an explanation, but let’s talk about the Kardashians for a bit. Kris Jenner is not just a mom, she is also a business mastermind. Seriously, this woman doesn’t just run a household, she runs a fashion, beauty, and media empire. She can’t be stopped! Now, for as much criticism as the Kardashian family can get, there is just no denying that this family is super close. Kris makes sure of it! Yes, they sometimes bicker and get into drama on television, but hey, Keeping Up With the Kardashians is a reality TV show, after all—what else do you expect?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>According to The New York Times, even though Kris herself admits that she is a bit of a control freak, she got into business because she wanted to set her children up for success.</strong></p><p>In fact, that’s why she initially pitched the idea for Keeping Up With the Kardashians—her first husband had just passed away, she had a large family, and she had just remarried, so she figured she had nothing to lose by running with the idea. And just look at where her crazy marketing skills have gotten them now! Her schemes always work.</p><h2 id=barely-sees-them-steven-tyler>Barely Sees Them: Steven Tyler</h2><p>It’s so rare to see photos of Steven Tyler actually spending time with his daughter Liv Tyler that many people do not even know that the two of them are related. Yup, there are people out there who have no idea that Liv is actually Steven’s daughter. As you can see in the photo above, the two do come together occasionally, but up until now, Steven and Liv barely saw each other. This occurred for a few reasons—just wait until you hear this crazy story!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>According to Vogue, Liv’s mother did not tell her that Steven was her father until she was nearly ten years old!</strong></p><p>In fact, Liv’s mother had raised her to believe that a totally different man was her father. Even after Liv found out the truth, Liv’s mother kept her away from Steven because his wild rock and roll lifestyle would not be a good influence for a young girl. However, it seems like they have definitely taken steps to having a healthy relationship. According to Lifetime, Liv says that she has no regrets about how her life has gone so far, and despite all the ups and downs, she would not change a thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=close-with-their-kids-jenna-dewan-and-channing-tatum>Close With Their Kids: Jenna Dewan And Channing Tatum</h2><p>Yes, we know, everyone had a bit of a broken heart the day that Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan announced that they were separating. These two just seemed like such a perfect couple—but even though it seems like nobody has any privacy these days, there must have been trouble going on behind the scenes. Even though they had been together for nearly a decade, the couple decided it was time to call it quits. However, they have not officially divorced yet, so perhaps there is still hope! Channing and Jenna have one daughter together. Her name is Everly, she’s four years old, and of course, she’s absolutely adorable!</p><p><strong>According to Romper, both parents have said that raising Everly to be happy and healthy is their top priority right now, even though they will no longer be living together.</strong></p><p>They have both stated that they love parenthood, even though it’s exhausting! And according to Channing’s Instagram, Everly loves doing arts and crafts, like painting her parents’ faces! Hopefully, they will still be able to share many sweet moments like this in the future. Clearly, they both love their daughter very much, and she is lucky to have them as parents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=barely-sees-them-joe-jackson>Barely Sees Them: Joe Jackson</h2><p>It’s common knowledge that Joe Jackson did not have a positive relationship with his children. Although he was clearly responsible for their early success, the public opinion of him and his treatment of the kids is typically negative, for a variety of reasons which we’ll get into. According to Vanity Fair, Joe and his wife raised nine children, but when Joe decided that he wanted his kids to pursue music, he put together a group of five of them—and as you probably know, these talented children, including Michael Jackson, became known as The Jackson 5.</p><p>Yes, these kids soon became international superstars—but at what cost? According to VH1, Michael said that his childhood was very lonely because his father was so strict and tough on him. Although he did give his father credit for helping him become so successful, and even forgave his father later in life, he reportedly told media figures like Oprah Winfrey that he was treated horribly as a child, all so that The Jackson 5 could sell more records and make more money. It’s no wonder that several of Joe’s children chose not to maintain any form of contact with him later in life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=close-with-their-kids-lily-aldridge-and-caleb-followill>Close With Their Kids: Lily Aldridge And Caleb Followill</h2><p>You probably know Lily Aldridge as a Victoria’s Secret model, but she’s more than that—she’s also a mom! According to Vogue, Lily met Kings of Leon frontman Caleb Followill at Bonnaroo music festival back in 2007, and it was love at first sight! Eventually, the couple got engaged in 2010, and they married in 2011. About a year later, Lily gave birth to their daughter, Dixie. You might think that as a model, Lily wouldn’t have a lot of time to spend with her daughter, but between her walks down the runway and Caleb’s shows, they make plenty of time to be together as a family.</p><p>According to Romper, Lily has to stay in great shape to be a model, so she likes to work out with Dixie by her side! They have a lot of fun staying active together. According to the Daily Mail, Lily and Caleb both say that their daughter is basically a “princess in training”—she loves to play dress up with her mom, try on fancy clothes, and pretend to be a Disney princess! In fact, the family also loves watching Disney movies together, and Lily says she would love to have more kids!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=barely-sees-them-courtney-love>Barely Sees Them: Courtney Love</h2><p>Courtney Love is a controversial figure. While some people love her music, and others admire her style and attitude, many people have some problems with her. For example, according to Vanity Fair, some people believe that she had a very negative influence on Kurt, and that their relationship was not the right choice for him. Others just find her personality off-putting. However, the opinions of the public are one thing, but her daughter’s opinion carries a lot more weight—and it’s only in recent years that these two have slowly begun to mend their relationship.</p><p>According to Entertainment Weekly, Courtney and her daughter, Frances, had a very strained relationship for many years. In fact, Courtney was simply not fit to be a mother when Frances was born, and Frances spent a lot of time living with her grandparents. Her grandparents had to play a big role in raising her because Courtney was so tied up in sorting out her own personal issues with addiction. It was a sad reality, but it tore the two of them apart. Now, Frances and Courtney seem to be coming back together, and you can occasionally spot them on the red carpet at awards shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=close-with-their-kids-elsa-pataky-and-chris-hemsworth>Close With Their Kids: Elsa Pataky And Chris Hemsworth</h2><p>Elsa Pataky and Chris Hemsworth just might be the best looking couple in Hollywood! So naturally, their daughter, India, and their twin sons, Sasha and Tristan, are beyond adorable. The funny thing is, the couple actually did not meet in a very romantic way—according to People, they actually met through their representatives! But despite this, they quickly fell in love (and honestly, it would be tough to resist falling for Chris Hemsworth, no matter the circumstances), and they started dating in early 2010. They got married around Christmas only a few months later, and Elsa gave birth to India about two years later in 2012.</p><p>You can often see this little family out and about around Hollywood, and now that the kids are growing up, they just seem to get cuter and cuter! According to E! Online, Elsa says that Chris is simply the best father to their kids, and she could not have asked for better. She says that they both value their family over everything, but they also still support each other in their respective careers. Elsa also says that overall, she could not be happier with her family and her life—we’re happy for them!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=barely-sees-them-david-hasselhoff>Barely Sees Them: David Hasselhoff</h2><p>According to CBS News, David Hasselhoff once set a Guinness world record...for being the most-watched man on TV. Crazy, right? His peak of fame might have been before your time, but your parents definitely would remember him. His career began on the long-running soap opera The Young and Restless, and he went on to appear in Knight Rider and most famously, Baywatch. After Baywatch ended, he appeared in films like Click and Dodgeball. It might seem like he’s a man who has it all, but behind the scenes, his family life slowly fell apart.</p><p>According to The Washington Post, there were times when David was not allowed to see his daughters because he was simply out of control. He struggled with addiction, and his daughters were both worried and embarrassed by his actions. In fact, his daughters begged him to get help, because they simply could no longer be around them. Eventually, he was able to recover, and the family reconciled. We’re not sure how close he is with his daughters today—he did put them through a lot—but hopefully, they have a better relationship with him now, and he won’t turn back to his old habits anytime soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=close-with-their-kids-reese-witherspoon>Close With Their Kids: Reese Witherspoon</h2><p>Okay, it’s already common knowledge that Reese Witherspoon and her daughter Ava look exactly alike—but seriously, just check out the photo above. These two could be twins! It’s no wonder they’re so close. Reese’s daughter is older than most of the children featured on this list—in fact, she’s not a child anymore, she’s actually 18 years old! Of course, Reese is close with her sons Tennessee and Deacon, too, but since Ava is her first child and her only daughter, it seems like they share a special bond—or maybe it just seems that way because they look the same!</p><p>If you want to see some super sweet photos of Reese and Ava spending time together, just check out either of their Instagram accounts! Whether it’s Mother’s Day, a birthday, or just a fun day out in Los Angeles, these two seem to do everything together! We love seeing a mother-daughter pair have such a great relationship in the midst of a crazy scene like Hollywood! According to People, Ava also models for Reese’s clothing line, and recently, she has begun accompanying Reese to some red carpet events. We can’t wait to see where Ava’s career takes her!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=barely-sees-them-bill-hudson>Barely Sees Them: Bill Hudson</h2><p>You might remember Kate Hudson from the quirky retro film Almost Famous, where she played a carefree groupie back in the 1970s. Since then, she has gone on to appear in a variety of films, like How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Raising Helen, You, Me, and Dupree, and Bride Wars. She’s beautiful, she’s blonde, she’s funny, and everyone wanted to be just like her character Penny Lane from Almost Famous. It’s easy to assume that she’s had a charmed life, but the truth is, she has a very strained relationship with her father, the actor, comedian, and musician Bill Hudson.</p><p>According to Venus.com, Kate says that she does not consider Bill to be her real father, because he barely knows her. They rarely spent any time together when she was growing up, but thankfully, according to MTV, she has a great connection with her mother, and says that she has learned a lot from her. MTV also reported that Kate basically considers the actor Kurt Russell to be her father—Kate’s mother, Goldie Hawn, has been dating him since the 1980s, and he helped raise Kate. It’s rare to see any photos of Kate with her biological father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=close-with-their-kids-demi-moore-and-bruce-willis>Close With Their Kids: Demi Moore and Bruce Willis</h2><p>Demi Moore and Bruce Willis may be a thing of the past—but their family connection is still strong. Both Demi and Bruce are very close with their children, Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah. Of the three, Rumer has done the most to make a name for herself in the entertainment industry, and because of this, she seems to share a special bond with her parents over their shared career choices. Rumer won season 20 of Dancing With the Stars, she made her Broadway debut in Chicago back in 2015, and she also has a recurring role on the show Empire.</p><p>Rumer has actually had the opportunity to work with her father Bruce twice on films sets, when she appeared in the movies The Whole Nine Yards and Hostage. According to People, Rumer says that both her father and mother have inspired her in countless ways. And it’s pretty crazy how similar Rumer and Demi look! On Instagram, Rumer has even posted about how the two of them look like they could be the same person. Too funny! It’s sweet that Rumer is so close with her parents still, even though she is in her twenties and they separated years ago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=barely-sees-them-jaid-barrymore>Barely Sees Them: Jaid Barrymore</h2><p>So, you already saw Drew Barrymore appear earlier on this list because she’s super close with her kids. And you might remember how we mentioned that Drew did not have such a happy childhood herself. Now, we’re about to explain why. As you can see, Drew’s mother isn’t being mentioned here because she was super close with Drew—quite the opposite. Drew’s mother, Jaid Barrymore, felt like her daughter could be her ticket to fame. After Drew became a break out child star for her role in E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, Jaid began taking advantage of her.</p><p>According to Vogue, Jaid would take Drew to Hollywood parties when she was underage and encourage her to go crazy and impress the older actors and actresses. She allowed Drew to partake in all sorts of destructive activities, until Drew’s physical and mental health began to suffer, and she finally sought treatment as a teenager. According to Vanity Fair, Drew eventually cut off all contact with her mother, recognizing her as a negative influence who lead her down the wrong path when Drew was too young to know any better. She moved away from her mother when she was fifteen, and hasn’t spoken to her since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>References: hellomagazine.com, people.com, forward.com, hellogiggles.com, instagram.com, twitter.com, eonline.com, ew.com, intouch.com, dailymail.com, newyorktimes.com, romper.com, vogue.com, mtv.com, vanityfair.com, harpersbazaar.com, vh1.com, lifetime.com, washingtonpost.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpYGKwprjEm6pmr5ikeqK%2BxGaapaejmnq1u4ytn56homK4qrDSZpinnF1mfW7Dx6hkm5mimrm6edKenGasmJq6cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-doctors-werent-happy-with-rob-mcelhenney-body-transformations.html><span>←</span><span>Why Doctors Weren't Happy With Rob McElhenney's Role Transformations</span></a>
