Other actors, though, seem to have careers defined by their onscreen deaths. One of those actors is <strong>Sean Bean</strong>, who is well known for playing roles in successful films and television shows, like <strong><a href=#>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Game of Thrones</a>.</strong> He's even more well-known for dying in them. With those deaths, however, has come some hefty career earnings. Here's how much Sean Bean has made from his onscreen deaths over the course of his decades-long career:</p><h2 id=bean-39-s-career-beginnings><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Bean's Career Beginnings</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before Sean Bean was dying onscreen on a regular basis, the Englishman was earning credits as a actor working both on screen and on stage. <a href=#>His first paid role</a> was Tybalt in a production of Romeo and Juliet at a theater in England, and for two years he was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, acting in further productions of the famous play, as well as other pieces of Shakespeare's work. Playing Tybalt, a character who dies, must have set the tone for much of Bean's career. His first onscreen death was as Ranuccio in the film Caravaggio.</p><h2 id=bean-39-s-total-onscreen-deaths><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Bean's Total Onscreen Deaths</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To date, <a href=#>Bean has died onscreen</a> a whopping 25 times, notably in <a href=#>Bond</a> film GodlenEye, <a href=#>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</a>, and in the wildy popular HBO series <a href=#>Game of Thrones</a>. Most of his deaths have been cruel and gruesome, like stabbings and beheadings, while others have been bizarre, like being torn apart by horses and being driven off a cliff by cows. Although Bean is, surprisingly, not the actor with the most onscreen deaths (Danny Trejo has died onscreen 65 times; Bean doesn't even make the <a href=#>top 10 list</a>), he might be the actor with the most unusual onscreen deaths.</p><h2 id=his-views-on-onscreen-deaths-today><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>His Views On Onscreen Deaths Today</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though there are plenty of actors who've died onscreen more than Bean, he's still played death so much so he's no longer taking roles where his character dies. "I've turned down stuff. I've said, 'They know my character's going to die because I'm in it!'" <a href=#>he's said</a> about his choice to now exclusively play roles where his character lives. "I just had to cut that out and start surviving, otherwise it was all a bit predictable."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sean Bean Won't Take On A New Movie Or TV Role Unless This One Condition Is Met</a></span></p><h2 id=bean-39-s-movie-earnings><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Bean's Movie Earnings</span></h2><p>If Bean's career is any indication, onscreen deaths can earn big bucks at the box office. The films he's been in have made over <a href=#>$5 billion dollars worldwide</a>. Acting in popular movies like a Bond film and a <a href=#>Lord of the Rings</a> installment certainly bolsters that aggregate, but it's still a laudable number. Fortunately for him, Bean was likely able to net some of that money, as actors often get a cut of their well-performing movie earnings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-39-game-of-thrones-39-salary><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>His 'Game Of Thrones' Salary</span></h2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B2oQMKxnZK6/</p><p><a href=#>Game of Thrones</a> is one of the most popular television shows of all time. It holds eight <a href=#>Guinness World Records</a> for its popularity and its awards performance. Given its popularity, one can assume that, as a star of the show, Bean's earnings were high. And that assumption is correct. <a href=#>Bean's saraly</a> for the HBO show was reportedly $120,000 per episode. While that's not much compared to some actors, like the cast of <a href=#>The Big Bang Theory</a> and even some of his <a href=#>GoT costars</a>, it's a lot of money to be paid to die.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sean Bean Never Watched The Ending Of 'GOT', But He's Happy About One Thing</a></span></p><h2 id=bean-39-s-net-worth><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Bean's Net Worth</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While he no longer wants to, dying on screen has been very lucrative for the star. Bean's unique character niche has earned him a desirable net worth. He's worth an estimated $20 million dollars according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. Comparitively, <a href=#>Danny Trejo</a>, the actor with the most onscreen deaths, is worth an estimated $8 million dollars, and <a href=#>Christopher Lee</a>, the actor with the second-most onscreen deaths, is worth an estimated $25 million dollars, both figures according to Celebrity Net Worth. These men are proof that an actor can make a living by dying, and a good living, at that.</p><h2 id=his-current-projects><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>His Current Projects</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today <a href=#>Bean is involved in a number of projects</a>, including ones currently on air and ones that will be soon. Bean appeared in 13 episodes of the TNT sci-fi drama <a href=#>Snowpiercer</a>, starring <a href=#>Hamilton's</a><a href=#>Daveed Diggs</a> and Peaky Blinders's Iddo Goldberg. He starred in the three-part BBC drama Time alongside Stephen Graham, and is currently filming the animated movie Watch the Skies. Here's hoping, for his sake, Sean Bean only plays characters who live moving forward.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Orlando Bloom Brings 'The Lord Of The Rings' Vibes To Instagram And Fans Are Loving It</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHqpu9ZmpK6bmGLApq3NZpmemZ5itLDAjKmYopxdm7yzeceiqmannqiws7HEp2SdnZGptbR5y6ipnWWfm3q1tMRmqaKml6h6qK3MnmSonl2ptbO7zZ6qaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./glenn-close-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Glenn Close Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
