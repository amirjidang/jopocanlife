I like the sound of that [in response to chants chanting her name],” Fatu said. “Now you better believe that the reason why I chose IMPACT… this company has the most storied women’s division in wrestling. I mean, from the beginning, the Knockouts Division has been the place to be for fierce competition, and I want a piece of it. I’m talking about amazing, talented women in this division, like Awesome Kong, Gail Kim, the legendary Mickie James, Deonna Purrazzo, and the talented Jordynne Grace.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Trinity’s appearance won’t air until the May 4 episode of IMPACT Wrestling, but IMPACT shared a teaser with a brief clip of her debut.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>IMPACT also confirmed that Trinity’s first match will take place at the second day of the Spring Slugfest tapings on April 29; she will face KiLynn King, one-half of the IMPACT Knockouts World Tag Team Champions.</p><p>On May 16, 2022, Naomi and Sasha Banks, the reigning WWE Women’s Tag Team Champions, walked out of a WWE RAW taping.
