The "Love The Way You Lie" hit maker has a half-sister named Sarah Mathers and a half-brother named Michael Mathers on their father’s side, and a half-brother named Nathan Mathers from Eminem’s mother, Debbie Nelson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is believed that Eminem and Nathan grew up together, with the self-proclaimed "Slim Shady" already being a teenager when their mother gave birth to the now DJ and professional personal trainer, Nathan. So there was quite an age difference between the pair, but from what has been gathered, Nathan’s experience growing up with Debbie was no different to Eminem’s.</p><p>Fortunately, by the time his big brother reached his mid-20s, Eminem had become so successful with his second studio album The Slim Shady LP that Nathan was able to begin working for his brother and ultimately change his life for the better. But are the pair still close today?</p><p><strong>Updated on March 7, 2023: </strong>Eminem continues to slay the top of the rap charts, claiming multiple music videos with over a billion views on YouTube <a href=#>as well as over 68.5 million monthly listeners on Spotify</a>. The artist, while experiencing a wild level of fame, makes sure to prioritize his personal relationships with his family and friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eminem's brother, Nathan Mathers, guest starred on an episode of his niece's podcast recently. Hailie Jade wanted him to reflect on what it was like growing up with Eminem, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mathers spoke nothing but praises for the rapper</a>, saying, "He was the best role model I could have had to help me be the dad that I am today... I started understanding a little more when reality would hit when I would start seeing him on TV and going to shows and all the signatures and crazy people. I’m like, 'All right, well, this is real.'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/eminem-slim-shady-music-video.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eminem-and-nathan-rsquo-s-relationship>Eminem And Nathan’s Relationship</h2><p>Eminem is no stranger to rapping about his family problems in his music, having penned tracks about everyone. From his toxic relationship with his mother, to his chaotic on-and-off romance with ex-wife Kim Mathers, to <a href=#>his sweet tributes to his daughter Hailie</a>, Eminem has broached it all.</p><p>He has also rapped about his relationship with his younger brother, Nathan, who tends to fall under the radar so often because he, similar to his famous sibling, tends to keep a very low profile and stays out of the limelight as much as possible.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Eminem's Daughter Hailie Is Engaged, But Did Eminem Release Any Type Of Statement?</a></span></p><p>Nathan is much younger than Eminem by a whopping fourteen years. They share the same mother but have different dads, so growing up with Debbie (who Eminem has already described in the past as a woman who made his childhood hell), it is fair to assume Nathan experienced a similar upbringing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In Eminem’s 2002 hit song "Cleaning Out My Closet," lifted from his fourth studio album The Eminem Show, the rap superstar touched on his broken relationship with his mother after mentioning his little brother in one particular line.</p><p>“You’re getting older now, and it’s cold when you’re lonely and Nathan’s growing up so quick he’s gonna know that you’re phony,” Em rapped about his mom on the track, who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he also accused of negligence and abuse</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar48026327.jpg><h2 id=eminem-was-a-father-figure-to-his-younger-brother>Eminem Was A Father Figure To His Younger Brother</h2><p>Eminem became a father figure to his brother after Nathan’s dad walked out on Debbie shortly after welcoming their son. It was claimed that social services were often called to the property where Nathan lived with his mother because Debbie was allegedly not taking care of her offspring.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Eminem's Home Intruder Got In More Trouble After Serving His 524 Day Sentence</a></span></p><p>Fortunately for the then-teenager, Eminem was awarded legal custody of his younger sibling when Nathan turned 16.</p><h2 id=what-is-nathan-up-to-these-days>What Is Nathan Up To These Days?</h2><p>It was said that Nathan worked for Eminem’s team for a few years, though it was never disclosed what his position was while helping steer his brother’s successful career.</p><p>Nathan gave rapping a shot, having released a string of singles including "Slide on Over" and "Shadow of a Celebrity." He has also been on multiple tours with Eminem and starred in several of the artists' music videos over the years.</p><p>Nathan resides in Michigan and is a married man, after tying the knot with his longtime partner Ashley Mae in 2018. Together, they share one daughter and two sons.</p><h2 id=eminem-39-s-strict-rules-for-parenting-hailie-jade-mathers>Eminem's Strict Rules For Parenting Hailie Jade Mathers</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong><strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2></h2><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened Between Eminem And Mark Wahlberg?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is no denying, judging by Nathan’s social media account, that he is still very close to Eminem and his daughter, Hailie, who makes an appearance on the rapper's Instagram account every so often.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nathan-Kane-Samara-Mathers.jpg><p>When Eminem graced the stage for the Super Bowl Halftime Show in February 2022, Nathan, as seen on his Instagram, was in attendance, alongside Hailie, who posed for snaps with her uncle that were shared on his official Instagram page.</p><p>As for Nathan’s relationship with his mom, while Eminem is said to have been much more forgiving about his mother’s past behavior, his brother is said to have not been so keen on the idea of a reconciliation, having deemed her as “mad” in a previous interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eminem-ends-his-feud-with-his-mother>Eminem Ends His Feud With His Mother</h2><p>Eminem seemed much more forgiving after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">releasing a song titled "Headlights" in 2014</a>, where he said that though he is still estranged from Debbie, he forgives her for the hurt and pain he endured in his childhood.</p><p>"I went in headfirst, never thinkin’ about who, what I said hurt," he raps on the track. "In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst. The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?</p><p>“'Cleanin’ Out My Closet' and all them other songs. But regardless, I don’t hate you ’cause, Ma.
