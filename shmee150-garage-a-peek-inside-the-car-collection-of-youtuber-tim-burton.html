His love for cars began as a hobby, wherein he posted pictures of supercars on his social media accounts. The hobby slowly morphed into a passion, <a href=#>leading him to create a YouTube account, Shmee150, in 2010</a>. While his following started in a small number, he continued to feature his favorite cars and offer general reviews about different models. His career took off after Burton began his car collection, which featured some of the most luxurious vehicles in the world. <a href=#>With over 2.3 million subscribers, the YouTuber has a strong following</a> who enjoy his purchases.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From Aston Martin to Ferrari, Shmee150 has amassed a multi-million dollar car collection in his garage that keeps periodically changing with the trends in the market. Let’s look at the current cars in Tim Burton’s garage.</p><h2 id=2022-zenvo-tsr-s-1-7-million>2022 Zenvo TSR-S ($1.7 million)</h2><p>Tim Burton arrived at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in June 2022 to collect his custom TSR-S from the automaker. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zenvo Automotive</a>, it is Burton’s first hypercar purchased, and he chose a Mother of Pearl purple shade for the automobile. He was involved in every step of creation and even visited the factory in Præstø, Denmark, to offer his input.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Peek Inside David Beckham's Insane Car Collection</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mclaren-12c-coupe-400-000>McLaren 12C Coupe ($400,000)</h2><p><a href=#>Always a fan of McLaren over Audi</a>, Tim Burton was choosing between an Audi R8 and McLaren 12C Couple in 2014, and he decided to buy the latter. He purchased the stunning coupe from the Manchester manufacturing unit and took it for several laps on an open circuit. The supercar cranks out 616 HP with its mighty V8 engine.</p><h2 id=ferrari-gtc4-lusso-578-000>Ferrari GTC4 Lusso ($578,000)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In February 2022, the YouTuber swapped his Porsche Taycan to add another strong V12 Ferrari to his collection with the GTC4 Lusso. The comfortable Ferrari is a four-seater with ample seating space for passengers. Shmee150 plans to close around 10,000 miles in the car during its first year.</p><h2 id=aston-martin-v8-vantage-roadster-120-000>Aston Martin V8 Vantage Roadster ($120,000)</h2><p>One of Shmee150’s first purchases was an Aston Martin Vantage Roadster in 2010. Hailing from the iteration manufactured between 2008 and 2012, the Vantage Roadster had a 4.7-liter engine, and the gearbox was modified for a smoother drive, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Auto Evolution</a>. Burton had once sold the vehicle but re-purchased it in 2021.</p><h2 id=renault-sport-clio-v6-255-23-189>Renault Sport Clio V6 255 ($23,189)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A moderate purchase for the YouTuber, he decided to buy a Renault Sport Clio V6 255 in May 2022 as a project for his museum to make a few tweaks and changes. The original car was first introduced at the Paris Motor Show in 1998, and the design was elevated two years later. The V6 engine produces a top speed of 147 MPH.</p><h2 id=renault-clio-1-2-24-310>Renault Clio 1.2 ($24,310)</h2><p>Renault Clio 1.2 was the first ever car that Tim Burton purchased back in 2005 when he was young. After looking through various websites and yards to buy back the model, he found the Clio in 2021 and immediately added the car to his collection. His Clio is a Phase 4 car, the last iteration released before 2012.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ferrari-sf90-stradale-750-000>Ferrari SF90 Stradale ($750,000)</h2><p>The YouTuber went to Italy in April 2022 to <a href=#>collect his royal blue Ferrari SF90 Stradale</a>. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ferrari</a>, the Stradale is a plug-in electric hybrid with a robust V8 engine that offers 1,000 HP. A few days after the purchase, he drove it to Nürburgring in Germany to drive a few laps and later had it delivered to his garage.</p><h2 id=ford-mustang-shelby-gt500-77-260>Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 ($77,260)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tim Burton added his first muscle car to the garage in a sea of luxury supercars with a 2022 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500. The lime green car is the US-made car in his collection that he collected in February 2021. Shelby GT500 remained in his American garage for a long time before it was shipped to the UK in September 2022.</p><h2 id=mclaren-senna-1-million>McLaren Senna ($1 million)</h2><p>McLaren dedicated Senna to its Formula One driver Ayrton Senna who won 61 Grand Prix during his well-established career. Tim Burton has been a massive fan of the driver and bought the car to commemorate him. He purchased the car in early 2019 but didn’t drive it until December. He also visited the Amalgam workshop in Bristol to create a miniature replica of his car with the iconic Cerulean Blue paint.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aston-martin-vantage-gt8-210-000>Aston Martin Vantage GT8 ($210,000)</h2><p>It has been five years since Shmee150 purchased the Aston Martin Vantage GT8 in 2017. The supercar was exclusively sold in Europe, and only 150 units were made of Vantage GT8, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Car and Driver</a>. Burton owns a royal blue shade with an orange accent to enhance the effect. He took the car on a ride at the 2022 Nürburgring Nordschleife for a few laps around the racing circuit.</p><p>The past notable cars in his collection include an Aston Martin DBS, Toyota GR Yaris, BMW M3 Competition, Mercedes-AMG G63, Porsche 911 GT3, and many more.
