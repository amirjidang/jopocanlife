The show quickly became known for its drama-filled episodes, with fans tuning in religiously to watch the latest episodes. While the original show is no longer airing, the family managed to land a new deal with the streaming network Hulu. The new show, The Kardashians, officially launched in 2022 and has viewers just as hooked as before.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Blink-182 Fans Are Hoping Kourtney Kardashian Backs Away Slowly From Travis Barker's Music, World Tour">Blink-182 Fans Are Hoping Kourtney Kardashian Backs Away Slowly From Travis Barker's Music, World Tour</a></span></p><p>The Kardashians' new and highly-anticipated show has so far focused on a relationship-based storyline, taking a closer look at both new and blossoming romances, as well as relationships that have been struggling. Fans have been given an exclusive look at Kim and Pete's courtship, as well as a rather intense peek into Travis Barker and <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian'</strong></a>s blossoming relationship.</p><p>Packed with plenty of PDA, drama, and laughs, fans have been left rather satisfied. However, some have been left wondering how exactly Kourtney and Travis met.</p><h2 id=kourtney-and-travis-first-met-in-2006>Kourtney And Travis First Met In 2006</h2><p>While the pair's relationship appears to be fairly new and exciting, it turns out that Kourtney and Travis had actually been friends for a whole fifteen years before a romantic relationship began brewing. This came as a shock to many fans, many of whom thought that the Blink-182 drummer had only recently appeared on the scene.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For a long time, the two lovers were part of the same social circle, so they were fairly familiar with each other. Travis knew of the Kardashian family through Paris Hilton, whom he was seeing at the time.</p><p>Over the years, they slowly became family friends. He eventually moved to the same gated community in LA as the Kardashian reality TV star in 2017, which may have well led to them spending more time together after her split from Scott Disick in 2015.</p><p>During this time, the pair reportedly started having dinner together at each other's houses.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="The Real Reason Kourtney Kardashian Doesn't Live With Husband, Travis Barker">The Real Reason Kourtney Kardashian Doesn't Live With Husband, Travis Barker</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an episode of The Kardashians, Travis claimed he knew he would end up with Kourtney eventually, noting, "I knew she lived in Calabasas, and I knew she was the love of my life, and I didn't even know her like that, but I just knew if I couldn't date her or be with her because she was with someone else that at least I could live by her."</p><h2 id=kourtney-and-travis-officially-began-dating-in-2021>Kourtney And Travis Officially Began Dating In 2021</h2><p>While the pair had been seen publicly flirting on Instagram for quite some time, fans were left in the dark for the most part when it came to knowing their relationship status. Were they together, or not?</p><p>Fans had waited a while for an answer, but in February 2021, it was officially confirmed that Kourtney and Travis were dating, confirming fans lingering suspicions. The loved-up couple confirmed the news via an adorable <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram snap</a>, where they were pictured holding hands.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since getting together, the pair has seemed almost inseparable, and their love for each other is abundantly clear through their romantic gestures. Later in 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Travis added a new tattoo to his collection in a sweet and romantic gesture to Kourtney</a>.</p><p>The Blink-182 band member had her name tattooed on his chest, and at a later date, he even let the reality star tattoo the words 'i love you' on his arm.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Is Khloe Kardashian Jealous Of Kourtney’s Marriage?

The pair is frequently seen packing on the PDA on The Kardashians reality show, showcasing that they are very much in love. Many fans seem to find this sweet and have expressed their joy in seeing that Kourtney is finally happy, and getting treated how she deserves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=travis-and-kourtney-got-married-in-2022>Travis And Kourtney Got Married In 2022</h2><p>Just a year after getting together, the couple revealed that they were getting married. Fans got an exclusive sneak peek of the moment during the first season of The Kardashians, where Travis was shown getting down to one knee on the beach and proposing to Kourtney among the romantic arrangement of flowers.</p><p>In May 2022, the pair officially tied the knot. However, in true Kardashian style, they went all out for the official event, opting for a gothic-themed wedding. The <a href=#>gothic-themed wedding cost around $3.5 million</a>, spending $5,000 alone on just the cake.</p><p>While some fans loved the wedding theme, others fans have felt as though Kourtney is changing herself for Travis. However, the pair still seem as happy as ever, despite some external criticisms from salty fans.</p><p>Currently, the pair are not living together, however, <a href=#>Kourtney has opened up to say that it is something that the couple is working toward</a>. Fans will have to keep their eyes peeled for any clues that spring out of the woodwork.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbaledOrmK%2Bho2Kur7CMpKauqqSjsrp50Z6YpaSpYrqmsdNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-hanks-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Tom Hanks Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
