The common area also comes with a gym, tennis court, and clubhouse.</p><p>Lamar and Khloe married in a televised ceremony in 2009, only a month after meeting. However, she filed for divorce in 2013 amid allegations of substance abuse and infidelity.</p><p>Nevertheless, the couple weren’t officially divorced until 2016. In fact, Khloe temporarily paused the proceedings in 2015 after Lamar overdosed at a Nevada brothel and was hospitalized.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time, there was speculation the pair were reconciling. But Khloe denied the rumors, later saying she only withdrew the divorce proceedings so she could make medical decisions on his behalf. She later re-filed, and the divorce was granted a year later.</p><p>It's unclear if Lamar and Khloe are in contact following their divorce.

The pair are apparently not together, despite welcoming a baby boy in the summer.</p><p>In July, <a href=#>Lamar admitted that he would’ve helped Khloe</a> have another baby if she asked.</p><p>“<a href=#>Oh, [Tristan] got caught cheating again?</a> And they’re gonna have another baby?” he told Page Six. “She could have hollered at me for that.”</p><p>Khloe never publicly responded to Lamar’s comments.</p><p>NEXT: <a href=#>Kanye’s Yeezy Brand Evicted Over $63,000 In Unpaid Rent</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>Instagram</a>, <a href=#>TMZ</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmalmZ2Wv267w6ikZqqVo8G0eZBuZ2lonaS7tbSMppinq5mku266xJqpZp2oYripuM6eZKSZopmutLTImqVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./julie-bowen-wears-sofia-vergaras-underwear-line-eby-details.html><span>←</span><span>Julie Bowen Wears Sofia Vergaras Underwear Line Eby: Details</span></a>
