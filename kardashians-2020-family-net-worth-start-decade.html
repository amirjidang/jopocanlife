The youngest members of the family are now young adults building an empire on their own. It seems that we are still going to hear a lot about them in the coming years. Here is how much each member of the family is worth today.</p><h2 id=rob-kardashian---10-000-000>Rob Kardashian -$10,000,000</h2><p>Rob Kardashian has a net worth evaluated at <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$10,000,000</a> and is the poorest member of the Kardashian clan. He also became famous and made part of his fortune thanks to the Keeping Up With the Kardashians show. After several scandals, he avoided being in the headlines. But he started to make appearances <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">last year</a>.</p><p>The only male sibling in the family seems to be the least keen when it comes to fame, and he didn't take advantage of it as his sisters did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=khloe-kardashian---40-000-000>Khloe Kardashian - $40,000,000</h2><p>Khloe Kardashian has the humblest net worth among the female members of her family. The star "only" has <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$40,000,000</a>, more than enough money for a lifetime. She made her fortune thanks to the Keeping Up With The Kardashians and spinoffs of the show. Khloe also spent the last decade busy with her own projects. Last year she released the <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twisted Sisters</a>, a true-crime show.</p><p>Like her sisters, Khloe has a great passion for fashion, and she has released the clothing line Good American. Of course, she also makes lots of money on Instagram, and she charged up to <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$250,000</a> per post in 2017.</p><h2 id=kendall-jenner---40-000-000>Kendall Jenner - $40,000,000</h2><p>Kendall Jenner has a net worth evaluated in <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$40,000</a>, just as much as her older sister Khloe. However, she might surpass her sister this year. Kendall grew up in use with fame, since she was just a child when The KUWTK became a popular show. She is more discrete than the rest of her family when it comes to her personal life, but it doesn't mean she doesn't know how to use her image to make money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=#>Million Dollar Smiles: 10 Wealthiest Super Models Of All-Time</a></span></p><p>Kendall Jenner is one of the most prominent models in her generation, and she is the <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">highest-paid model</a> in the world. She took the crown away from Gisele Bundchen, who remained in this position for several years. Kendall represents a new era of models that are also Instagram celebrities.</p><h2 id=kourtney-kardashian--45-000-000>Kourtney Kardashian- $45,000,000</h2><p>Kourtney Kardashian had a net worth estimated at <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$45,000,000</a> in 2019. She built her fortune thanks to the reality show, and the spinoffs, like Kourtney and Kim Take New York and Kourtney and Khloe Take Miami. She also released some clothing lines during the last decade, and she might still do it in the coming years.</p><p>Just like her sisters, Kourtney also takes advantage of the power on social media to make money. Hiring her to make a post on Instagram to endorse a product can cost up to <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$250,000</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kris-jenner---90-000-000>Kris&nbsp;Jenner&nbsp; -$90,000,000</h2><p>What would be of the Kardashian clan if it wasn't Kris Jenner? Many people believe she is the one responsible for the family becoming famous, and the media often call her momager. Of course, she also collects millions of fans and haters. While many people consider Kris a brilliant woman, others just see her as a cold person who only aims for fame and money.</p><p>Like her or not, Kris Jenner has a net worth evaluated at <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$90,000,000</a>.

And it seems that this decade will be no different.</p><h2 id=caitlyn-jenner---100-000-000>Caitlyn Jenner - $100,000,000</h2><p>We can still count Caitlyn as part of the clan, and she has a net worth evaluated at <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$100,000,000</a>.As we know, the last decade changed Cailtlyn's life forever. She was under the public eye when she decided to transition and change from the world-wild famous athlete Bruce Jenner to Caitlyn Jenner. Of course, she also made money thanks to the reality shows and also a spinoff.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although we often see Caitlyn around the family, she is no longer so much under the public eye in the last years.

He has a net worth evaluated at <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$250,000,000</a> that comes from music but also from different business endeavors. Kim and Kanye are worthy over half a million dollars if we put their net worth together.</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian---370-000-000>Kim Kardashian -$370,000,000</h2><p>Kim Kardashian can't complain about her finances in the last decade. She ended 2019 with a net worth evaluated at <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$377,000,000</a>. It is impressive, especially if you consider that in 2010 she "only" had <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$44,000,000</a>. Like her or not, Kim Kardashian, the 2010s were the years when Kim Kardashian proved to be an excellent entrepreneur and also a person who knows how to manage her image to make lots of money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kim Kardashian’s 10 Best Tweets Of 2019, Ranked</a></span></p><p>Kim owns the KKW Beauty, a beauty line, and last year she launched the SKIMS Solutionwear.

Of course, it is easier when you come from a family that is worth millions, but we have to give her some credit.</p><p>The young entrepreneur decided to change the Kylie Cosmetics, business model. The products were just available online, but after signing a contract with Ulta, there was a boost in sales. According to Kylie, she just showed up in some shops and posted on her social media, and it does wonders for sale.
