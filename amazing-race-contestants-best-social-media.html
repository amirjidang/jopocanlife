There are some, however, who keep their social updated. Here are 10 former amazing race contestants who have the strongest social media game.</p><h2 id=tyler-oakley>Tyler Oakley</h2><p>Tyler Oakley is no stranger to the spotlight. This social media darling&nbsp;got his start&nbsp;vlogging on&nbsp;Youtube before he competed in both the 28th and 31st season of Amazing Race. He and his teammate were strategically competitive, and, as a result, they did very well throughout the competition and placed highly both times.</p><p>His fame&nbsp;may have helped him along the way and certainly wasn't dampened after it all. Tyler Oakley has 7.5 million&nbsp;subscribers on Youtube, 5.9 million followers on Instagram, and 6.07 million followers on Twitter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=korey-kuhl>Korey Kuhl</h2><p>Korey Kuhl is the&nbsp;best friend&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amazing Race partner of&nbsp;Tyler Oakley.

The couple met while on Survivor, and Amazing Race fans doubted their tactics for joining the cast of the show.</p><p>The two were fierce competitors and were asked back on the show because of their innovative gameplay. Though the two have been taking time to focus on their family, Mariano&nbsp;maintains a&nbsp;notable Twitter presence, boasting 167k followers, and 37.2k followers on Instagram.</p><h2 id=rachel-reilly>Rachel Reilly</h2><p>Rachel Reilly is no stranger to television.
