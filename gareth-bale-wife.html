Recently, Gareth has represented LAFC in the US and Wales in the World Cup.</p><p>The Wales national team captain, Gareth Bale, announced his engagement to Emma Rhys-Jones in a 2016 social media post which stated<strong> “She said yes!! This is a birthday weekend I won’t forget for a long time.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The two had been together for almost two decades and finally tied the knot in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>While Emma Rhys-Jones is Welsh like her husband, she likes to stay out of the limelight and prefers privacy, with only sixty guests receiving an invitation to the event just hours before it took place.</p><p>From her father’s criminal past to rumors of emotional troubles between herself and her husband, Emma has been unable to avoid the limelight.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, much of the attention that follows her is largely negative in nature as people attempt to uncover deaths about her past complications.</p><p>As Emma Johnson continues to strive for a normal life amidst such chaos, it is only fair that she has some privacy regarding her personal matters.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Children of Gareth Bale and Emma&nbsp;</h2><p>In his lengthy retirement announcement, Gareth Bale described his family in a highly endearing manner. Alongside longtime partner Emma Rhys-Jones, Bale is the proud parent of four children: Alba Violet, Nava Valentina, Axel, and Xander.&nbsp;</p><p>Each of the births served as a monumental occasion for the <a href=#>family</a> and was commemorated publicly in Bale’s statement. While the children are still young, it’s heartening to see just how devoted he and Emma are to their growing young family.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>About Emma&nbsp;Rhys-Jones</h2><p>According to reports, Emma Rhys-Jones is from Cardiff. Emma was raised in the north Cardiff neighborhood of Llanishen. Her family lives in a neighborhood not far from Gareth Bale’s home. The two reportedly lived close to one another while they were kids.</p><p>She grew up in Llanishen, a district in north Cardiff a couple of miles from Bale’s family home. The couple began dating in the early 2000s while attending Whitchurch High School.</p><p>Though her family’s home may now be a few miles away from Bale’s in relation to current boundaries, her history with him – along with the shared time spent together as young ones growing up nearby – could well be part of what binds the couple.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCzwKucraBdl66tsYywoJ%2BdXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./casey-beane.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Billy Beane's daughter Casey Beane?
