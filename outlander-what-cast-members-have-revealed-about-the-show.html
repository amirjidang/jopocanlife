Now that the show has made it to its fifth season - hopefully, with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a storyline that has won fans over</a> once again - the cast and crew have revealed what it's been like to work on such a challenging and demanding set.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From real-life weather conditions (many scenes are shot out in nature) to how it feels to work so closely with other actors, they've covered it all, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">including some surprising BTS tidbits</a>.</p><p>While not everything is sunshine and rainbows on the set of&nbsp;Outlander, one thing that's for sure is the chemistry between the cast members...and not just between Claire and Jamie. A little good-natured humor and patience go a long way, and the cast has plenty of interesting things to say about that.</p><h2 id=caitriona-balfe-who-plays-claire-claims-the-period-accurate-costumes-help-her-get-into-character><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Caitriona Balfe, Who Plays Claire, Claims The Period-Accurate Costumes Help Her Get Into Character</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/claire-outlander.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Those familiar with the show know that those corsets are not just for looks. The female lead knows all too well just how restrictive they can be - she&nbsp;has said that this is one of the things&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that allows her to get into character</a> - the restrictive nature of the corset reflects the restrictions placed on women during that time period.</p><h2 id=sam-heughan-believes-the-show-has-a-unisex-appeal-to-audiences><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Sam Heughan Believes The Show Has A Unisex Appeal To Audiences</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/sam-heughan-interview.jpg><p>The audience for&nbsp;Outlander&nbsp;isn't defined by gender, and Heughan, who plays the role of Jamie, claims he's not completely surprised. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One thing fans might not know about the actor</a> is that he does have some opinions&nbsp;about&nbsp;the show. In an interview with Elle, Heughan said that the show has more than just racy scenes - it also has violence, so there's lot of different types of action for every type of viewer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=diana-gabaldon-made-a-cameo-on-the-show-and-had-some-interesting-things-to-say><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Diana Gabaldon Made A Cameo On The Show And Had Some Interesting Things To Say</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/diana-gabaldon-e1591810750903.jpg><p>It's not unusual for the writer of a book-turned-TV-show to appear on set (just ask Stephen King), but Gabaldon definitely had some interesting things to say after her time spent on the show. She played the role of Iona MacTavish and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote all about it on her website afterward</a>.</p><h2 id=balfe-and-heughan-had-instant-chemistry><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Balfe And Heughan Had Instant Chemistry</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/claire-and-jamie-outlander.jpg><p>The crew of the show will be the first to admit how challenging it was to find the right person to play the role of Claire. Just when they were at their wit's end and starting to sweat, Caitriona Balfe came into the picture. As soon as she and Heughan were on set together, the connection was undeniable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=despite-balfe-s-first-scene-being-so-intense-she-drew-excitement-from-the-experience><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Despite Balfe's First Scene Being So Intense, She Drew Excitement From The Experience</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/claire-nurse-outlander.jpg><p>The first episode of&nbsp;Outlander&nbsp;was not a G-rated show by any means. Balfe admits that it was an intense scene to shoot, but one that she drew excitement from, rather than nerves. This excitement is what helped propel her forward, through the chaos.</p><h2 id=richard-rankin-enjoyed-driving-the-crew-crazy-with-his-constant-singing><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Richard Rankin Enjoyed Driving The Crew Crazy With His Constant Singing</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/roger-rankin-singing-e1591810967254.jpg><p>Anyone who has seen interviews with Richard Rankin - who is indeed a skilled musician in real life - will have undoubtedly noted his contagious sense of humor. It's this same humor that kept him practicing his debut song&nbsp;on the set, despite pleas from the crew to stop. This was something he found quite amusing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tim-downie-relished-playing-such-a-twisted-antagonist><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Tim Downie "Relished" Playing Such A Twisted Antagonist</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/tim-downie-outlander.jpg><p>Tim Downie plays an interesting character in&nbsp;Outlander and it's one that many love to hate. His role as Governor William Tryon was based on a real historical figure, and when asked about playing the role during an interview with EW, Downie responded by calling his character "the devil incarnate". He said it was "fun" to play someone so "Machiavellian and twisted."</p><h2 id=heughan-was-so-in-shape-during-filming-that-he-ran-two-marathons-in-four-weeks><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Heughan Was So In Shape During Filming That He Ran Two Marathons In Four Weeks</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/sam-heughan-marathon.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This shouldn't come as a surprise, but it's a tribute to the sheer amount of work the cast members commit to on-set. Heughan had no hesitations when it came to running not one, but two, marathons while filming season four of the show, and he even beat his own personal best.</p><h2 id=the-famed-wedding-night-took-five-days-to-shoot><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Famed Wedding Night Took Five Days To Shoot</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/claire-and-jamie-wedding-scene.jpg><p>Not every scene is one and done, especially not scenes that require a decent amount of intimacy and choreography, such as Jamie and Claire's wedding night. This scene alone, from start to finish, took five days, according to director Anna Foster. She shared this insight in an interview with&nbsp;Marie Claire.</p><h2 id=every-intimate-scene-is-strictly-choreographed-down-to-hair-movements><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Every Intimate Scene Is Strictly Choreographed, Down To Hair Movements</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/claire-and-jamie-mirror.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not one thing is left to chance when it comes to perfecting these scenes. Everything the fans see has been choreographed down to each movement, no matter how small, so that it looks and feels as real as it can be. This results in longer filming times, but stunning scenes when it's all over.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything The Star Wars Cast Has Said About The Franchise</a></span></p><h2 id=tobias-menzies-slept-for-a-whopping-12-hours-straight-after-his-scene-at-culloden><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Tobias Menzies Slept For A Whopping 12-Hours Straight After His Scene At Culloden</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/randall-and-jamie.jpg><p>That's not to say Menzies isn't in shape! The Battle of Culloden was a rough scene for everyone, and from a fan's point of view, the cinematography is flawless. While both Menzies and Heughan had stunt doubles who were able to fill in if needed, they both chose to commit to the scene in a personal way, as there were many close-ups that weren't appropriate for doubles, anyway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything The Game Of Thrones Cast Has Said About The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=sophie-skelton-studied-her-on-screen-parents-in-order-to-capture-a-realistic-likeness><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Sophie Skelton Studied Her On-Screen Parents In Order To Capture A Realistic Likeness</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/outlander-cast.jpg><p>When Sophie entered the picture, it was like watching a miniature, female version of Jamie come to life onscreen.

The scars look unbelievably realistic from the viewpoint of the fans, and the reason for that is the work (more than two hours!) that goes into creating them. Understandably, Heughan isn't the most patient during this process...but beauty is patience, after all.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Outlander: 10 Storylines That Hurt The Show (And 10 That Saved It)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGimrqyclrulsdFmrqGZpGKwor%2FTZqSepZKav7R5x5qtnmWimsOmrcuem2aZkqTCtXnToZxmq5ikxHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./was-george-jones-married-to-tammy-wynette-heres-what-we-know-480882-html.html><span>←</span><span>Was George Jones Married To Tammy Wynette?
