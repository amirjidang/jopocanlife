However, how much they are reported to spend on their nannies is an eye-watering sum of money.</p><h2 id=how-much-money-do-brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolie-spend-on-childcare>How Much Money Do Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie Spend On Childcare?</h2><p>A glimpse into what it costs to run the Jolie-Pitt household was revealed by People Magazine in 2018, when Lindsey Thomason, CEO of Los Angeles-based The Nanny League, shared information with the publication with regard to the cost of a full-time nanny. It is reportedly $140,000 a year, excluding health insurance.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's Real Estate Portfolio Was Unrivalled During Their Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the same interview, it was said there would be at least two nannies for a household of this size. This seems a reasonable sum to spend, especially for a couple as wealthy as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. However, other reports have indicated that the family had a much larger team to take care of the children. Daily Mail claimed in a report that at one time, the family employed between six and nine nannies, one to focus on each child. The nannies were reportedly rotated every six months to prevent attachment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/_brad-and-angelina-properties.jpg><p>The publication adds that in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">last year of the couple's marriage</a>, some changes were made and Angelina Jolie's brother, James Haven, moved in to help care for the kids, taking on the role of "chief nanny."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-this-small-fortune-brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolie-spend-only-on-nannies>Is This Small Fortune Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie Spend Only On Nannies?</h2><p>The <a href=#>former couple made headlines</a> in 2011 when a report stated that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they spend $10 million a year on their children</a>. This seems like an absolute fortune, but Forbes magazine explored the amount, revealing that after taking Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's salaries into consideration, they were not "spending an outsize amount on their children."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Angelina Jolie Fired Her Nanny Just Before Her Divorce For Getting 'Too Friendly' With Brad Pitt</a></span></p><p>The cost could be broken down into several things, including health care, transportation, food, clothing, education, and more. With six children, it is little wonder that this figure would be high, but the family also lives a life of luxury, with transportation costs including private jets, first-class tickets, nannies, and private tutors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/angelina-jolie-and-her-kids.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A source told HollyBaby (via Forbes) that the breakdown for the spending included "more than a million on private tutors who travel around the world with them" and $900,000 on six nannies (one for each child). It was also reported that their annual spending included hotel bills, extravagant birthday parties, and a large grocery bill which included room service and eating out.</p><h2 id=who-are-brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolie-39-s-children>Who Are Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie's Children?</h2><p>With all this talk on what it costs to take care of Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie's children, it seems only appropriate to go into more detail about who is a part of their family. The couple has six children, a mix of biological and adopted, who have impacted their lives in many positive ways.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Are-Brad-Pitt-And-Angelina-Jolie-On-Speaking-Terms.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first is Maddox who was originally adopted by Jolie from an orphanage in Cambodia in 2002. She later adopted her daughter, Zahara, from Ethiopia. While the first two children were initially adopted by Jolie, Pitt later adopted them, too. The couple then had their daughter, Shiloh in 2006, and not long after, in 2007, adopted Pax from Vietnam. The last additions to the household were twins, Knox Léon and Vivienne Marcheline, born in 2008.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Angelina Jolie Warn Emily Ratajkowski About Brad Pitt?</a></span></p><p>It is a large and multicultural brood, each with their own likes and dislikes. These children have brought immense happiness to the former couple and have been the topic of several interviews that they have given. Angelina Jolie has previously told People Magazine that her large family has had a positive impact on her children's upbringing. "They're pretty great people and because there's so many of them, I think they've had a very significant effect on each other," she said. "I have six very individual human beings in my home…"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/angelina-jolie-with-her-kids.jpg><p>Brad Pitt has also given an interview about his children and how they changed his life for the better. "I feel like the richest man alive since I've become a father," he told Psychologies magazine in 2014 (via Us Weekly). "Being a father has changed me on so many levels and made me more generous and alive. I see my children as an essential part of my life. I love being a father and all the responsibilities that entails."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being a father is not without its challenges though, and Pitt is reported to have said that the intense "emotional bond and responsibility" of being a father resulted in him worrying about his family all the time. He continued, "I care about them more than I care about myself, which I think is the real definition of love. You see past yourself and become more generous and giving, and wanting only the best for your family."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/What-Brad-Pitt-And-Daughter-Shilohs-Relationship-Is-Really-Like.jpg><p>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie ended their relationship in 2016, and there would have been many adjustments that came with this split. There are also <a href=#>reports that the bond between Pitt and Maddox</a> has changed significantly. This includes Maddox reportedly wanting to legally change his last name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He doesn't use Pitt as his last name on documents that aren't legal and instead uses Jolie," a source told Us Weekly in 2021. "Maddox wants to legally change his last name to Jolie, which Angelina has said she doesn't support." However, his relationship with his younger children seems to be mostly unchanged.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Angelina-Jolie-Spends-A-Fortune-On-Bodyguards-For-Her-Children.jpg><p>"He thinks the world of all of his children and loves having them over at his place in L.A., where they enjoy long meals together, take walks around the estate, and sometimes drive up the coast where they'll enjoy hikes on the beach," a source told Us Weekly in 2022. The same report also revealed that Pitt has taken great lengths to ensure his time spent with his children is "extremely private."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq5mUYr2qwNNmmKeflaG2r62Mo6aloZVisKm1y52pnqZdo66vuthmqpqkkafGcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brad-falchuk-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Brad Falchuk Net Worth How Much is Falchuk Worth?</span></a>
