It’s weird, when I watch the film now it seems supermassive but when we were filming it felt somewhat intimate and contained. Even more so because Zack was always there, he was always present because he was also working as the DP and the cinematographer so he was always there with a camera in his hands. So it wasn't like I had to walk off set or away for the director to come and get notes to talk about things. So it looks like a massive, epic world on film but when we were shooting it seemed very contained which is a real special thing."</p><p>He's enjoying the limelight as of late, recently appearing on the 'Ellen Show' alongside <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong>.</a> She got ended the interview by gifting Dave a lunchbox.

It is a special gift <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he can add to his already impressive collection.</a> He discussed&nbsp;the prestigious set alongside Uproxx, "I have some that are actually really pretty rare and hard to get. I don’t have a huge collection. I’ve seen collectors with much bigger collections. A lot of people are really focused on international collections or very obscure lunchboxes, and I just kind of focus on what I like and what I remember as a kid: TV shows that I loved, superheroes, stuff like that. And a few that are kind of rare that are hard to get."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dave Bautista Puts Himself On Blast After Candid Pic Of Him Circulates</a></span></p><p>As for if he uses the lunchboxes or not, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that's a big-time no</a> for the Hollywood star, "Oh God, no!" he says, laughing. "I don't even like people to touch it because I'm afraid it'll get scratched or get banged up...
