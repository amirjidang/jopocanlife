However, moments into the chorus he needed to pause. The packed crowd at <a href=#>the Worthy Farm stage</a> shouted out the lyrics in his place.</p><p class=p1>“I’m not crying, you are,” one <a href=#>Twitter</a> user wrote early on Sunday, June 25. “Brilliant from the crowd & brilliant too from Lewis. Even though he knows he’s struggling, he still goes on the stage & that takes true courage.”</p><p class=p1>Another <a href=#>added</a>: “As his Tourette’s overwhelmed him, and he needed a break thousands of voices lifted him up. I feel something akin to a religious experience hearing them sing. The effect on Lewis Capaldi must have been profound. You don’t even have to like the song to get choked up. Beautiful.”</p><p class=p1>Capaldi — who won <a href=#>a Brit Award</a> for “Someone You Loved” in February 2020 — announced in September 2022 that he had been diagnosed with Tourette’s Syndrome.</p><p class=p1>“I’ve always had it apparently,” the “Wish You the Best” crooner<a href=#> explained&nbsp;during an Instagram Live&nbsp;session</a>. “So, I do the shoulder twitch quite a lot and you see underneath every TikTok people are like, ‘Why is he twitching?’ Which is fine. Curiosity is fine. I get it.”</p><p class=p1>Capaldi added at the time: “It’s a new thing, I haven’t really learned much about it — I’m learning. I’ve&nbsp;got Botox on my shoulder&nbsp;to stop it moving. It worked for a bit, but the worst thing about it is when I’m excited, I get it, when I’m stressed, I get it, when I’m happy, I get it. It happens all the time.”</p><p class=p1>Capaldi, who has also been candid about his <a href=#>mental health struggles</a>, announced earlier this month that he had canceled his lineup of concerts leading up to Glastonbury.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I need to take a moment to rest and recover, to be at my best and ready for Glastonbury and all the other incredible shows coming up so that I’m able to continue doing what I love for a long time to come,” he wrote in an <a href=#>Instagram</a> statement on&nbsp;June 5. “I’m getting all the help and support I need from the incredible people around me, who I’m so grateful for.”</p><p class=p1>Capaldi noted on Saturday that he plans to <a href=#>extend his touring hiatus</a> after the British festival. “So you probably won’t see much of me for the rest of the year, maybe even,” he noted. “But when I do come back and when I do see you, I hope you’re still up for watching us.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOer5moeqStz5qjnaFdlr2wuM6goLOdo2LBsHnGpZisrJ%2Bjr7a%2B2Gaaq6enmXqistOeqWakn6i2r7OMr6aim5Vk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lamar-odom-rents-15000month-mansion-near-ex-khloe-kardashian.html><span>←</span><span>Lamar Odom Rents $15,000/Month Mansion Near Ex Khloe Kardashian</span></a>
