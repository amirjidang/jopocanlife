The crowd erupts into applause as the “Truth Hurts” artist hands the flute back to its keeper before grabbing a microphone and saying “Bi**ch, I just twerked and played James Madison’s crystal flute from the 1800s. We just made history tonight! Thank you to the Library of Congress for preserving our history and making history freaking cool! History is freaking cool, you guys!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The pop singer even treated the attendees to a brief history lesson in the midst of her set. Evidently, the crystal flute was a gift to President Madison to celebrate his second term and was one of two things saved in a fire, with the other being a portrait of the first United States President George Washington.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">American history and Black history were made once again in Washington, D.C.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6G2u8bOZmlpaF2usqK%2BjKijnWWTp8a0wMClZJ%2BkpamybrjIm6maqqlisLC6xqucrKtdZn90gJVybmluaWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lily-safra-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Lily Safra Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
