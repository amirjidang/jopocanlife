"We finally committed to each other and did everything we promised each other the first night in 2016," the text reads. "Our castle in the sand had to crumble, so we could rebuild on solid ground. I yuh you so muchhh."</p><p>The couple met at the Need a Favor musician's concert in Las Vegas, but Bunnie XO (real name Alyssa DeFord) was in a relationship at the time. After she broke up with her former partner, she and Jelly Roll (real name Jason Bradley DeFord) started dating. They did not wait long before getting engaged (Jelly Roll <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">proposed onstage during one of his concerts</a>) and <a href=#>married at a Las Vegas chapel</a> in 2016. However, the announcement that they split in 2018 surprised many, and fans have reacted with messages of support.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Every relationship has to go through the storm at some point to find the light," one fan commented. Another shared similar thoughts, writing, "Girl, I get it. I actually divorced my husband and came back, and we have never been happier. It's me and him against the world. I couldn't be happier. I'm glad you found the same."</p><p><strong>It appears many fans have found themselves in similar situations and understand how the couple could have a stronger relationship after a breakup</strong>. "Me and my husband are 8th Grade sweethearts, and we went through a 2-year separation and still fought our demons to be together till to this day," one TikTok comment reads. "What makes the relationship is the fight your both."</p><p>"I remember watching you through that breakup and then you two reuniting," a fan commented. "I can't believe it was that long ago already. Your love story is an inspiration!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-has-jelly-roll-said-about-his-relationship-with-bunnie-xo>What Has Jelly Roll Said About His Relationship With Bunnie XO?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/bunnie-xo-and-jelly-roll-2.jpg><p><strong>In 2023, the couple renewed their vows in Las Vegas. This was partly to show their commitment to each other again, but also because they disagreed on their original wedding date</strong>. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jelly Roll shared their reason</a> for this with People in a December 2023 interview. "There was always a discrepancy with our anniversary because she thought it was on one day. I thought it was on another day. Neither one of us knew," he said.</p><p>They decided to renew their vows on September 1; as the musician explained, it "felt right because we thought it was between the 30th and 31st."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/country-rapper-jelly-roll-has-an-enormous-net-worth-but-his-youtuber-wife-bunnie-xo-might-make-more-than-him.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Country Rapper Jelly Roll Has An Enormous Net Worth, But His Youtuber Wife Bunnie Xo Might Make More Than Him</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jelly Roll and Bunnie Xo are the definition of a modern social media power couple and their net worths are equally impressive.</span><p>Jelly Roll has been open about his love for his wife.
