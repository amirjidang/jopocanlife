They were like a second family to me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Amy-Carlson-Opens-Up-About-Leaving-%E2%80%98Blue-Bloods-It-Was-a-%E2%80%98Difficult-Decision-Amy-Carlson.jpg><p>She added that “it’s always a difficult decision” when you’re faced with leaving a show. Carlson, who was a season regular since season 2, did not come back after season 7. During the season 8 premiere, it was revealed that her character had been killed in a helicopter crash while on duty.&nbsp;Deadline <a href=#>reported at the time</a> that she felt it was time to leave the show and her contract was up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Amy-Carlson-Opens-Up-About-Leaving-%E2%80%98Blue-Bloods-It-Was-a-%E2%80%98Difficult-Decision-Len-Cariou-Tom-Selleck-Sami-Gayle-and-Amy-Carlson.jpg><p>She raved to&nbsp;Us about her friendship with Wahlberg, who she’s remained close to since leaving. “He and I text all the time. We’re still very close and we’re great friends,” she said. “We were there for each other for a long time. He has said some of the nicest things ever about me to the press and has never waived in that support. He’s been super generous and a lovely person.”</p><p>However, following the Blue Bloods panel at the Paley Center in New York City, Carlson read a review of what was said and was not pleased.&nbsp;“I am appalled and sad about comments made @paleycenter about Linda’s demise on #BlueBloods,” she tweeted following the Q&A.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I am appalled and sad about comments made <a href=#>@paleycenter</a> about Linda’s demise on <a href=#>#BlueBloods</a> <a href=#>#inaccurate</a> I ❤️show, cast and playing her <a href=#>@EW</a></p><p>— amy carlson (@TheAmyCarlson) <a href=#>October 17, 2017</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She also tagged&nbsp;Entertainment Weekly, causing fans to think she was referencing the comments her costar&nbsp;<strong>Bridget Moynahan</strong>&nbsp;had made to the magazine. “We were all disappointed to see that she was going,” <a href=#>Moynahan, who played Carlson’s sister-in-law in the show, said</a>. “It was unfortunate that she made that decision at the end of season 7, so we were stuck with the story line as we could get it … But I’m really thrilled for her to go off and pursue other things and follow what she felt was best for her.”</p><p>Blue Bloods airs on CBS Fridays at 10 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJimsV2YrrO40qilZqegmru0edSpZJqan6rBbrjEmq2ippdir63BxGaZpaefmcButdNmrpqrXZZ6pbXFn6CcrZypeqWxwqKqoqeeZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1425531-alpha-academy-last-chance-qualifying-matches-set-for-12-5-wwe-nxt.html><span>←</span><span>Alpha Academy, Last Chance Qualifying Matches Set For 12/5 WWE NXT</span></a>
