She was an A-lister and for several years she was on top of her game. It didn’t matter if her movies were box office hits or not – everyone wanted to know what Halle Berry was up to and who she was dating at the time. Plus, there’s no denying that Halle did a good job of lighting up every red carpet on fire. The woman was, and still is, smokin’ hot. A good portion of her fame came from fans who admired her for her gorgeous looks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet, for some reason Hollywood stopped casting Halle Berry in movies. For producers and directors, she doesn’t draw audiences the same way that she used to. Her latest projects have been flops, and most of Hollywood seems to have forgotten about her. Plus, there’s no denying that Halle has made more headlines for her messy personal life in recent years than anything else. She tends to attract the bad boys, and as a result, has a hard time focusing on her work as an actress and her projects.</p><p>With that being said, we’ve got 15 reasons why Halle Berry is being ignored by the entertainment industry. It’s pretty sad, especially since Halle still looks the same way she did 10 years ago, and still has what it takes to be an A-lister again. Yet, any movie that features her is considered box office poison. Here’s why.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-messy-personal-life><strong>Her Messy Personal Life</strong></h2><p>If you are a guy that is looking to date <a href=#>Halle Berry</a>, prepare yourself. And we mean that very seriously. Looking at her track record, she might not be one of the easiest Hollywood women out there to date. It’s also safe to say that she carries a lot of baggage with her, and it’s not necessarily the kind of baggage that you want to deal with.</p><p>Halle has had several messy divorces in her past, with her most recent one with her ex <a href=#>Olivier Martinez</a>. He had quite a temper (he’s known for his scuffles with the paparazzi) and let’s just say that Halle isn’t the kind of person who would back down in a fight, either. Their marriage literally exploded right in front of their very own eyes. And it’s not like anyone didn’t see it coming, too.</p><h2 id=is-she-difficult-to-work-with><strong>Is She Difficult To Work With?</strong></h2><p>Now, we know that Halle Berry might be difficult to live with (according to all three of her ex-husbands, allegedly), but is she difficult to work with too? That’s what a lot of fans and critics want to know.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately, we haven’t heard any stories of Halle Berry being diva on the set of her films to her co-stars and the crew. For the most part, she remains very professional while she’s on the scene. After all, Halle has been in this business for decades. She knows exactly what to say and when to say it, too. Plus, she already gets enough bad press from her messy personal life. The last thing she needs is for people to call her a difficult, unprofessional diva. Even when she does get frustrated, she does a good job of masking it.</p><h2 id=was-she-ever-talented-to-begin-with><strong>Was She Ever Talented To Begin With?</strong></h2><p>A lot of people would say that one of the reasons why Halle Berry made it in Hollywood is because of her physical attributes and not her talent. Sure, she won the&nbsp;Oscar for Best Actress back in 2001, but unlike other actresses in the entertainment industry, she struggled to land any good roles since then. In fact, many of her movies have been rather mediocre, to say the least.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As much as Halle probably doesn’t want to admit this, she’s on-screen eye candy. Many casting directors choose her for their projects because they know that the majority of the male population want to look at her. And that’s not necessarily a bad thing. But that might also be the reason why she’s no longer in films. People have a hard time seeing past her good looks.</p><h2 id=but-she-s-not-controversial><strong>But She’s Not Controversial</strong></h2><p>Halle Berry really hasn’t said or done many controversial things throughout her career. Yes, her ex-husbands have said some pretty harsh words about her, but she doesn’t act like a complete maniac in public (unless it involves her kids and the paparazzi, but even then she’s managed to keep her cool). As a matter of fact, the only supposed controversy she’s been involved in during these last few years is when she wore her hair in its natural state to the Oscars. Seriously. She made headlines because of her natural curls!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Otherwise, Halle keeps things on the down low. She doesn’t engage in illegal activity, she doesn’t party and she certainly doesn’t make a fool out of herself on the red carpet. Despite all of this, people still can’t get past all of the rumors that Halle is a control freak behind closed doors.</p><h2 id=box-office-bombs><strong>Box Office Bombs</strong></h2><p>Speaking of bad film roles, a lot of Halle Berry’s movies have been box office bombs. And because she’s failed to bring in audiences, she’s since shifted gears to television work, too. Unfortunately, that hasn’t worked out too well for her either.</p><p>Her last few movies, The Call, Movie 43, Cloud Atlas and Dark Tide all bombed at the box office. They also received some pretty harsh reviews, too. That’s why Halle decided to skip movies all together and work in television instead. Unfortunately, her series Extant&nbsp;didn’t do very well either. It only lasted two seasons on the small screen. Since then, Halle has struggled to find work and is only being featured in small, forgettable roles in movies that no one really wants to watch, including Kidnap, Kings, and Kingsman: the Golden Circle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-her-oscar-do-her-wrong><strong>Did Her Oscar Do Her Wrong?</strong></h2><p>Halle Berry once said that winning an Oscar really didn’t change the game in the entertainment industry. It didn’t help her and it certainly didn’t do much for other up and coming actresses in Hollywood, either. It’s almost as if people have forgotten about her win back in 2001. And for Halle it’s clearly upsetting because she was hoping to be the one person who would break the mold. Instead, things just went back to the way they were before her win.</p><p>Yet, Halle still insists that winning an Oscar was the best thing that has ever happened in her life. It was a highlight, even though it was followed by a string of lowlights. She even once said, “I carried my Oscar to bed with me." Clearly it was meaningful to her, but it didn't cause her career to take off the way most people thought it would.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-might-have-passed-her-expiration-date><strong>She Might Have Passed Her Expiration Date</strong></h2><p>As painful as it is to say this, a lot of people think that Halle Berry might just be passed her expiration date. Now, that’s not to say that she’s no longer a hot commodity (have you seen her recent selfies?), but with the new crop of younger, fresher, and more talented actresses out there, Halle just can’t keep up.</p><p>Simply put, Hollywood is a nasty business to be in and it’s an especially brutal one for women. Movie producers are very quick to make you an overnight star but at the same time, they will chew you up and spit you out in a hot minute. Unfortunately, that might have been the case with Halle. With so many new actresses that are in demand, Halle is no longer on the top of anyone’s list anymore.</p><h2 id=she-still-wants-attention-from-her-fans><strong>She Still Wants Attention From Her Fans</strong></h2><p>And while Halle hasn’t had any luck in finding good roles, that doesn’t mean she’s ready to leave Hollywood completely. She still wants attention from her fans. Anyone who has been following her on her social media accounts will tell you that. Halle Berry loves to show off what she’s got and trust us, it’s still all there. She’s one of very few actresses who looks nothing like her real age. In fact, she could easily give younger stars a good run for their money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Plus, Halle is no quitter. She once said, “There have been so many people who have said to me, 'You can't do that,' but I've had an innate belief that they were wrong. Be unwavering and relentless in your approach.”</p><h2 id=but-she-s-a-social-media-temptress><strong>But She’s A Social Media&nbsp;Temptress</strong></h2><p>If you follow Halle Berry on Instagram, you’ll see right away that she loves to show shots of her running around in her bikini at some kind of exotic beach far, far away. She also loves posting photos of her assets without exposing too much at the same time (we would even go as far as saying that she pays attention to Instagram’s posting rules and guidelines!).</p><p>Simply put, Halle doesn’t want people to forget about her, even if half of the industry already has. She still wants to remind people that even though she’s over 50, she looks better than some of the twenty-something actresses out there that are desperate for their big break. She’s also a big, big enticer. With Halle, you can watch, but you definitely can’t touch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-is-too-confident><strong>She Is Too Confident</strong></h2><p>Being confident is never a bad thing. Heck, for some jobs you need it in order to survive. But, it might also be the reason why some actresses like Halle Berry fail to get work any more. That’s because they are so overly confident that they think they don’t have to ask or beg for work. They think that their phone is always going to ring off the hook and that they will always be in demand. Unfortunately, Halle Berry has learned the hard way that this hasn’t been the case whatsoever during these last few years.</p><p>Yet, Halle doesn’t see it this way. She even attributes her appearance to her confidence. She once said, “When you have short hair, there's just a feeling of here I am. What you see is what you get. And there's a confidence that comes with wearing short hair and I like the way that makes me feel.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-delayed-motherhood><strong>She Delayed Motherhood</strong></h2><p>A lot of people were surprised when Halle Berry first announced that she was expecting – at age 43. They thought that she would be the kind of actress that would keep her focus on her career or simply adopt later on in life, like so many of her peers have done. But not Halle. She might have delayed motherhood, but it’s one of the best decisions she’s ever made in her life.</p><p>Halle once put it this way, “Nature has got it all wrong: When you are younger, it should be harder to get pregnant, and as you get older it should be easier. When you are so ready, you can't do it to save your life. And when you are 21, you are so not ready, but you are ripe as could be. The eggs should become more developed the older you get, not&nbsp;go away slowly from the day you're born. That's one thing God got wrong.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-olivier-vs-gabriel-fight><strong>The Olivier Vs. Gabriel Fight</strong></h2><p>Now, no one knows what really goes on behind closed doors when it comes to Halle Berry. But what we do know is that Halle has had some nasty custody fights with her ex baby daddy, <a href=#>Gabriel Aubry</a>. It was so ugly that the tabloid media reported on all of the ex-couple’s dirty laundry. It was one accusation after another.</p><p>At one point, Halle tried to take the couple’s daughter away and move to France full time. But because that didn’t happen, their feud escalated into an all-out brawl. Olivier allegedly beat up Gabriel on Thanksgiving Day in 2012. His face was hurt that he was nearly unrecognizable. A lot of people pointed their fingers at Halle, though, for allowing the fight to get as big as it did.</p><h2 id=she-still-keeps-her-faith><strong>She Still Keeps Her Faith</strong></h2><p>A lot of people would have long quit the industry if they were in Halle’s shoes. I mean, there’s only so much begging you can do, right? Now, that’s not to say that Halle is begging for roles, but she’s made it pretty clear that she still wants to work. One of the things that still keeps her going is her positive attitude for the future and of course, her faith. She says that without it, she wouldn’t be where she is today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Halle once said, “I meditate and pray all the time. The faith and respect that I have in the power of God in my life is what I've used to keep myself grounded, and it has allowed me to move away from the storms that were in my life.”</p><h2 id=she-was-one-of-the-highest-paid-actresses-in-hollywood><strong>She Was One Of The Highest Paid Actresses In Hollywood</strong></h2><p>During the mid-2000s, Halle Berry was at her prime. She was at the top of her game and better yet, she was also one of the highest-paid actresses in the entertainment industry. She was also involved in a lot of productions behind the scenes. Everyone wanted to cast Halle in their films. She was a Bond girl in Die Another Day, was the highlight of the 2001 crime drama Swordfish, and also starred in the X-Men film.</p><p>Yet, her star began to fade the moment she began dating her ex-husband, Olivier Martinez. Also, no one wanted to associate with Halle after his nasty fight with her ex, Gabriel Aubry. Some critics would even go as far as saying that all of the bad choices Halle made in her personal life might have affected her paycheck. Seeing how she barely works anymore, we would say the same thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-she-have-a-future-in-hollywood><strong>Does She Have A Future In Hollywood?</strong></h2><p>The ugly truth is that a lot of actresses Halle’s age don’t get many offers in Hollywood. In fact, the movie roles begin to dwindle down after the age of 40. Yes, a lot of people call it misogynistic, ageist, and awful, but it doesn’t look like the industry is going to change its ways anytime soon. Halle will have to fight for her right to work, which is pretty sad. Still, she’s determined to make it happen one way or another.</p><p>Halle once put it this way: “When an opportunity comes your way, it's about making sure you're prepared to be the one who can walk through the door and deliver the goods. And I've had a lot of luck on my side and I've been prepared for that luck.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2nsqK%2FzqeqZq%2BYrnqprculnGaalae%2FunnRrqCnnZRitaa%2BjKiup2WWlrqmew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./siesta-key-casts-dating-histories-whos-hooked-up-with-who.html><span>←</span><span>'Siesta Key' Cast's Dating Histories: Who's Hooked Up With Who?</span></a>
