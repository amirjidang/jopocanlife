But, of course, since she is dating someone who has been the subject of much criticism, that means that she can't escape online commentary.</p><p>As Logan Paul and Nina Agdal's relationship has become more serious, people have become curious about what she actually thinks about him. She's not only dating a huge celebrity but she's dating someone who people have talked about quite a lot. Here's what Agdal has shared about her partner and whether she is bothered by the things that he has said and done.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-nina-agdal-really-think-about-logan-paul>What Does Nina Agdal Really Think About Logan Paul?</h2><p><a href=#>Logan Paul and Floyd Mayweather's boxing match</a> became famous, and in October 2023, Paul boxed Dillon Danis. It's possible to say that this fight got even more attention because, before it ever happened, Danis kept talking about Nina Agdal. He said some terrible things about her and seemed very focused on who she dated before Paul.</p><p>According to Outkick.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Logan Paul commented on the situation</a> on his podcast Impaulsive. He said that from his perspective, Nina Agdal was aware that she was entering a relationship with a famous person whom people talk about a lot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/does-logan-paul-s-model-girlfriend-nina-agdal-make-more-money-than-the-controversial-youtube-star_.jpg><p>He said, “I’m eternally sorry for Nina. I’ll spend the rest of my life apologizing if I have to for putting her through that kind of torment. It’s inhumane what he did. She’ll hold him accountable, but this is my life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paul continued:</p><p>"I dragged her into this social media fight bullsh*t. She did not sign up for this. I mean, she did. She did, of course, but she didn’t know and neither did I. I don’t think anyone knew the extent to which he would take things. No fight organization or promotion has ever seen this kind of build up. This is gnarly."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/the-truth-about-lia-marie-johnson-and-logan-paul-s-relationship-did-the-youtube-stars-actually-date-each-other_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Lia Marie Johnson And Logan Paul Actually Date?

That makes sense as this situation definitely escalated quickly.</p><p><strong>What happened between Logan Paul and Dillon Danis:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Logan Paul won the match (according to CNN)</strong></li><li><strong>Dillon Danis posted photos of Nina Agdal online with some exes</strong></li><li><strong>Danis edited pictures to make it seem like she dated stars like Brad Pitt</strong></li><li><strong>Danis tweeted "Logan on a man level you need to call this marriage off now" (according to Men's Health)</strong></li><li><strong>Agdal sued Danis in September 2023 (according to ESPN)</strong></li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Nina Agdal doesn't seem to have commented on this specific situation, she did talk about Logan Paul on his show Impaulsive earlier in 2023. She explained that she is okay with his scandals because she feels that he has changed. Agdal made it clear that even though she had of course heard about his scandals, once she met Paul and began chatting with him, she felt a bond with him.</p><p>She said:</p><p>"After 30 seconds I was like, 'You know, everyone has their baggage'... Obviously this is way more public than any other person... He's gone through so much hardship and he's been canceled multiple times and he's had multiple people turn on him."</p><p>According to Fandomwire.com, Agdal also said that when she had the chance to work with Paul before they began dating, she wasn't sure because of the way that people felt about him. It seems that she is completely aware of the scandals that he has been involved in, but she believes that he is different now, and she feels good about their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/how-close-is-logan-paul-s-fiance-nina-agdal-to-jake-paul-and-his-girlfriend-jutta-leerdam_-1.jpg> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/what-logan-paul-controversy-ended-his-relationship-with-the-rock_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Which Logan Paul Controversy Ended His Relationship With Dwayne Johnson?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Dwayne Johnson and Logan Paul became friends until their relationship was torn apart by controversy.</span><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Nina Agdal And Logan Paul's Relationship</p></th><th scope=col><p>Important Dates (According to Distractify.com)</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>first meeting</p></td><td><p>2022</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>shared their romance on Instagram</p></td><td><p>December 2022</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>got engaged</p></td><td><p>July 2nd 2023</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>In her Impaulsive interview, Agdal also said, "I think it was more of a learning curve throughout the relationship where it was like, Okay I'm dating someone who obviously is in the limelight and that has controversies and that keeps pushing the envelope and that keeps doing him unapologetically."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nina-agdal.jpg><p>She continued that they will "go through ups and downs like any relationship" and she is there for him.

He was interviewed on The MMA Hour in late September 2023 and said, “We’re very close, in my opinion… I think we’re very close to a final resolution. That’s what I mean when I say I’m rectifying it.
