She’s a dancer, fashion designer, recording artist, and actress. She’s regarded as one of the most beautiful celebs of all time. Her personal life and many relationships have garnered her a great deal of attention. Regardless, all the attention has only raised her profile in Hollywood. She has an estimated net worth of a whopping $360 million. She is one of the most in-demand celebs that every director, record producer, and fashion designer wants to work with. However, she is also known for being one of Hollywood’s most notorious divas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Hot Hollywood Divas Nobody Wants To Be Around</a></strong></p><p>In the last several years, J-Lo has gained quite the reputation for being a demanding diva, although she denies being one and resents the title. She has made waves at hotels and on movie sets with her list of demands that must be met. In fact, she's made several requests at major events. She likes things to be a certain way and needs certain items to perform. Some of her demands are reasonable while others are quite extravagant. Here is a look at J-Lo’s Diva Demands: 20 of Her Most Extravagant Requests.</p><h2 id=list-of-demands><strong>List Of Demands&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Jennifer Lopez has been associated with the diva image for most of her career. Her diva-like reputation was reinforced when a two-page list of her demands went public in 2007. This list is often sent to hotels and studios ahead of her arrival. In fact, it was sent to the five-star Dorchester hotel in London. The list includes specific notes for housekeeping.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>The preferred room temperature is 80F/26C. She requires two humidifiers and two oscillating fans.</strong></p><p>She also requests a large number of candles, which must be either lime blossom or Jo Malone’s Grapefruit. The second room is set up for her wardrobe and includes clothing steamier, iron, and a hanging mirror for her makeup. The list notes that J-Lo loves white and red roses or white lilies.</p><h2 id=all-white-everything><strong>All White Everything</strong></h2><p>J-Lo needs everything to be perfect in order to perform, and it starts with her dressing room. Lopez comes from a very humble beginning in showbiz. Her family was quite poor as she grew up. Eventually, she worked as a backup dancer for New Kids on the Block and Janet Jackson. She came a long way from being a backup dancer to a megastar. J-Lo has specific requirements for her dressing rooms for performances and interviews.</p><p><strong>For a BBC interview, she required enough dressing rooms for her 90-person entourage.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Most Difficult Outfits Jennifer Lopez Has Ever Had To Put On</a></strong></p><p>She is also known for being very particular when it comes to the decor of her dressing rooms. She demands to have an all-white dressing room, including white candles, tables, couches, drapes, tablecloths, and flowers.</p><h2 id=don-t-bother-her-in-first-class><strong>Don't Bother Her In First Class</strong></h2><p>In 1991, Jennifer Lopez landed her biggest gig as a Fly Girl dancer on the popular sketch comedy series In Living Color. She was chosen out of 2,000 applicants and received the job after the original dancer was unable to continue in the show. She eventually left the series to focus on her own goals. Now, she flies all over the world to promote films and perform for sold-out crowds. Rumors have circulated that J-Lo is even a diva when flying in the air. Reportedly,</p><p><strong>when flying First Class, she doesn’t like anyone to bother her—even the flight attendant.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One time, a flight attendant offered her a drink and she refused to acknowledge him. She said to her assistant, “Please tell him I’d like a Diet Coke and lime.” This rumor hasn’t been confirmed but does reinforce her diva image.<b>&nbsp;</b></p><h2 id=stealing-the-spotlight><strong>Stealing The&nbsp;</strong><b>Spotlight</b></h2><p>Jennifer Lopez demands the very best at all times. She even demands to have the very best music and producers. However, rumors swirled that this diva would even go as far as stealing songs. Jennifer first dabbled in some acting before embarking on a music career. In 1999, she dropped her first album, On The 6. It was met with positive responses. She released several more albums, including&nbsp;J. Lo, Rebirth, and Como Ama una Mujer.&nbsp;Lopez has been accused of stealing songs from other artists.</p><p><strong>Singer Chante Moore claimed that Sean Combs gave a track she was working on to J-Lo, which became her hit single “If You Had My Love.”</strong></p><p>Apparently, Jennifer lifted two songs and the concept for her album,&nbsp;J. Lo, from Mariah Carey’s Glitter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=playlist-demands><strong>Playlist Demands</strong></h2><p>Jennifer Lopez is still making new music and landing major roles. She is currently working on her next album, Por Primera Vez, which is to be released in 2018. She is also set to star and executive produce the live television musical Bye Bye Birdie. The release date has been pushed to sometime in 2018 due to Lopez’ busy schedule. Music is obviously a big part of her life.</p><p><strong>Back in 2007, before iPods were all the rage, J-Lo demanded to have a VCR and CD player in all of her hotel rooms.</strong></p><p>The CD player was mandatory along with an assortment of CD’s. She requested salsa, R&B, and hip-hop albums along with a very long list of artists, including Lauryn Hill, Enrique Iglesias, Mary J. Blige, and Santana.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-eye-contact><strong>No Eye Contact</strong></h2><p>In 1997, J-Lo had her big breakthrough when she portrayed Selena Quintanilla-Perez in the film Selena. It was a success with audiences and critics. Lopez was praised for her performance. She has been very successful as an actress and has appeared in numerous films. She is one of the most recognizable and popular celebs in the world. She’s a major star that has a large staff working for her. Apparently, she also makes demands from her staff. In 2012, reports surfaced that Lopez demanded that staff working for her make no eye contact or speak with her. While having work done on her San Fernando Valley home, she demanded that none of the helpers, drivers, or contractors have any interactions with her, although these rumors were never confirmed.</p><h2 id=traveling-in-style><strong>Traveling In Style</strong></h2><p>In 2002, Jennifer Lopez starred in the romantic comedy Maid in Manhattan, which also starred Ralph Fiennes. She went all over the world promoting the romantic comedy. When she landed in London she had people talking about her demands. When promoting the movie, she had a very interesting encounter with hotel staff. She stayed at the Metropolitan Hotel and showed her early signs of being a diva. The hotel staff was amazed by her lavish and extravagant demands.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>J-Lo And&nbsp;Other Actresses Who Are Hot, But Can't Act</a></strong></p><p><strong>Apparently, she requested the hotel staff to provide her with "thousands of pounds" of lemon-scented candles.</strong></p><p>It’s safe to assume that Lopez has probably never taken an Uber. She only travels in style even when it’s a short distance. She had seven limousines escort her to lunch at the Dorchester only 200 yards away.</p><h2 id=the-diva-and-the-maid><strong>The Diva And The Maid</strong></h2><p>J-Lo requests that all hotels give her privacy. In 2012, it was reported that she had a maid fired from her job, although Lopez has vehemently denied that. Jennifer was staying at the Melia Dusseldort in Germany. A maid working at the hotel, Pray Dodaj, approached the diva's room to get an autograph. She spoke with Lopez’s assistant who denied her. The next morning, Dodaj was fired. She said,</p><p><strong>"A day later the cleaning company that employed me at the hotel called and said the Ms. Lopez had complained…I was fired right there on the phone because of an autograph."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lopez and the hotel deny that she was fired for that specific reason. J-Lo called the story "hurtful."</p><h2 id=the-perfect-suite><strong>The Perfect Suite&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>In the 90’s, J-Lo was one of the few celebs&nbsp;who could easily go back and forth between her music and film career. She has starred in several popular movies, including&nbsp;Out of Sight, The Wedding Planner, and Monster-in-Law. The combination of her music and film career helped turn her into a major star. With her enormous success came a long list of requests that the superstar requires.</p><p><strong>She has very specific food and beverage notes for the hotels she stays at.</strong></p><p>J-Lo’s personal suite must include a coffee maker, hot water pot, toaster, microwave, and oven all set up before she arrives. Additionally, she requests plates, coffee mugs, thermos cups, and silverware. She also demands 12 bottles of water for her second room—her wardrobe room.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-fly-girl><strong>The Fly Girl</strong></h2><p>Apparently, it wasn’t fame that made J-Lo a demanding diva. She always had it in her and always demanded the spotlight. During her time on In Living Color, she first began to display her diva attitude. At the time, actress Rosie Perez served as the series choreographer for the Fly Girls. In 2014, Perez released her memoirs and recounted what it was like working with Lopez.</p><p><strong>Perez noted that several of the other dancers would often come to her complaining that Jennifer was “manipulating wardrobe, makeup and me, all to her advantage.”</strong></p><p>Later Perez claims that Lopez yelled at her and said, "I work my (expletive) off, deliver and you keep pushing me aside, treating me like (expletive)! I know I’m good! I’m better than any of these girls, and you know it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=j-lo-amp-a-rod><strong>J-Lo & A-Rod</strong></h2><p>Jennifer Lopez’s relationships are often in the spotlight. She has been in several high-profile relationships that made headlines all over the world. She’s been in much talked-about relationships with Sean Combs, Ben Affleck, and Casper Smart. From 2004 to 2011, she was married to Marc Anthony, and they had twins together. In 2017, she made headlines again when news broke that she was dating former New York Yankee Alex Rodriguez.</p><p><strong>Rumors spread that J-Lo would only consider marrying A-Rod if he agreed to a list of demands.</strong></p><p>Reportedly, he’s not allowed to talk to any women under the age of 40. Additionally, J-Lo loves his physique and wants a guarantee that he won’t let himself go once they get married. None of these rumors have actually been confirmed.</p><h2 id=american-idol-judge><strong>American Idol&nbsp;Judge</strong></h2><p>After having an enormous amount of success in her career, J-Lo began to fade away from the spotlight for a combination of reasons. She hadn’t released a major single or feature film in years. She had attempted but nothing caught on like earlier in her career. However, she saw an opportunity to revive her career as a judge on American Idol. Regardless, she still had a list of demands that needed to be met.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>During negotiations to appear on season 10, she requested to be paid $20 million and wanted a green-lit movie.</strong></p><p>She ended up making roughly $15 million for her first season as a judge. She also demanded to have a “dressing room compound” and a personal stylist. She later appeared on season 11 and seasons 13 to 15. For later seasons, she was paid between $17.5 million to $20 million.</p><h2 id=food-demands><strong>Food Demands</strong></h2><p>Jennifer Lopez is considered one of the most beautiful Hollywood stars. She is known for her killer body and world-famous assets. Like all major movie stars, she has very specific requirements when it comes to food. Her infamous list of demands includes everything she wants waiting and ready for her at the hotel. She requires a fruit platter consisting of watermelon, green seedless grapes, pineapple, and mango. She also needs a separate veggie platter, which includes carrots, broccoli, and ranch dressing. Of course, she also has a wide range of junk food she enjoys, including regular potato chips, soft baked chocolate chip cookies, and sour cream and onion potato chips. Additionally, J-Lo is nothing without her Planters Sunflower seeds with shell and her plain M&Ms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=breakfast-requirements><strong>Breakfast&nbsp;</strong><b>Requirements</b></h2><p>In 2011, J-Lo made her triumphant return to television as a judge on the reality competition series American Idol. However, she wasn’t done with television just yet. In 2016, she began portraying Detective Harlee Santos on the NBC crime drama Shades of Blue. She continued to land movie roles and create new music. In 2007, her list of demands showed that she has a very specific way that she likes things to be. Lopez has an insanely busy schedule so she likes to have things ready to go.</p><p><strong>Anytime she books a hotel and she arrives early, she wants breakfast waiting for her in the room.</strong></p><p>She requires scrambled eggs, bacon, pancakes, white toast, and potatoes. She also requests regular and decaf coffee that must be ready for her arrival.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-s-going-on><strong>What's Going On?</strong></h2><p>Jennifer Lopez is known for her tireless efforts to help the poor and less fortune. She is heavily involved with several causes, such as American Red Cross, LGBTQ rights, and HIV/AIDS research. In 2001, she created some waves when she participated in a charity event but, as usual, had a few demands. She joined an all-star lineup in recording a remake of Marvin Gaye’s classic hit, “What’s Going On?” Proceeds went to benefit AIDS programs in Africa and American Red Cross’ September 11 fund.</p><p><strong>In order for her to participate in the recording and video, she demanded a 45’ trailer that had to include a makeup station and hair sink.</strong></p><p>As always, she requested an all-white dressing room that had to be absolutely perfect.</p><h2 id=too-many-extravagant-requests><strong>Too Many&nbsp;Extravagant&nbsp;Requests</strong></h2><p>J-Lo is such a huge star that most of her demands are usually met. On a few occasions, her list of extravagant requests has actually, in fact, backfired. In 2013, she was set to perform at the opening ceremony of the Indian Premier Cricket League. The event is often compared to the Super Bowl and has quite a large audience. The year before, 56 million viewers tuned in to watch Katy Perry perform. It was estimated that Lopez would get an audience close to 60 million. However, her demands essentially cost her the event. She asked for a large number of hotel rooms for her massive entourage, which includes her personal chef and stylist. She also demanded a private plane. In the end, organizers rejected her requests and instead brought in Pitbull to replace her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=queen-of-vegas><strong>Queen Of Vegas</strong></h2><p>In January of 2016, J-Lo began her residency in Las Vegas with her concert series All I Have. She signed a three-year contract to perform roughly 120 shows a year at Planet Hollywood’s Axis theater. She makes $350,000 for each show and performs three times a week. However,</p><p><strong>the large salary wasn’t enough to convince her to agree to the terms.</strong></p><p>She also made a few other demands. She requested three penthouse suites all next to each other. She asked for a playground in her suite for her kids. She also demanded a personal laundry service and for each room to have its own on-call butler wearing all white. The housekeeping staff had to sign full disclosure agreements to ensure they don’t spill any of her secrets. She requested brand new toilets for the backstage area and an all-white dressing room.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beverage-demands><strong>Beverage Demands</strong></h2><p>It appears for the time being that J-Lo has no plans to retire anytime soon. Lopez is currently set to star in the romantic comedy Second Act. There is speculation that she’ll portray real-life drug lord Griselda Blanco in an HBO series that is currently in development. She is also not done being a diva that demands the absolute best, especially when it comes to her beverages. She has a special section for beverages on her list.</p><p><strong>She requires Smart bottled water both room temperature and refrigerated.</strong></p><p>The bar must be set up before her arrival with lemon wedges, honey, and bottles of Coors lite. She also requests regular coke, diet coke, and caffeine-free regular coke along with fruit punch or orange Gatorade both at room temperature and refrigerated.</p><h2 id=jenny-doesn-t-have-time-for-her-block><strong>Jenny&nbsp;Doesn't Have Time For Her&nbsp;Block</strong></h2><p>In 2002, J-Lo released her third studio album, This is Me….Then. The album received mostly mixed to positive reviews but featured one of her most popular singles, "Jenny From The Block." It would become J-Lo’s signature song. However, her list of demands contradicts that she’s still Jenny from the block. In 2011, she appeared in a Fiat commercial in which she drives down the streets of her old neighborhood, the Bronx. However,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Lopez only agreed to be in the commercial as long as she didn’t have to actually go to the Bronx.</strong></p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Fashion Photos Of Jennifer Lopez's Style Evolution (Jenny From The Block To J-Lo)</a></strong></p><p>All of Lopez’s scenes were shot in Los Angeles. Lopez wouldn’t even go to New York to shoot scenes of her driving down her old block. Instead, a body double was used for all the scenes shot in the Bronx.</p><h2 id=demanding-diva><strong>Demanding Diva</strong></h2><p>In 2010, Jennifer Lopez wowed audiences with her stellar performance at the World Music Awards in Monaco. She performed a melody of her biggest hits, including "If You Had My Love," "Love Don’t Cost a Thing," "Let’s Get Loud," and "Waiting For Tonight." She was more demanding than ever when performing at the World Music Awards that year. She had a long list of demands that had to be met.</p><p><strong>She requested that the entire hotel floor and private beach be reserved for herself. She also wanted an on-call masseuse as well as a twelve-person hair and makeup team.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Additionally, she requested a stand-by helicopter and a custom speedboat with a champagne fridge. To top it off, she demanded $4400 diamond-encrusted headphones to block out the noise from the speedboat’s motor.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>Diva Rappers' Most Ridiculous Demands</a></strong></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dailymail</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmiilaO7qrLEq2Slp6Cax262jKWmZqWfqMFuvsidoJytnKTCtHnDnqSappSofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-taylor-lautner-gay-age-height-net-worth-482410-html.html><span>←</span><span>Is Taylor Lautner Gay?
