According to a co-star, Tom Cruise's kisses are icky and wet. And Leonardo DiCaprio? Forgettable, according to a female lead. Additionally, if reports of Ben Affleck's bad breath and Orlando Bloom's body odor are true, then kissing them cannot be a pleasant experience. When Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe filmed a fantasy make out sequence for one of the Harry Potter films, he was surprised by her intensity and called her a bit of an animal. But that's good, isn't it?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's more good news. There are some great star kissers out there. <a title="Zac Efron Net Worth" href=#>Zac Efron</a>, <a title="Scarlett Johansson Net Worth" href=#>Scarlett Johansson</a> and (no surprise here) Kristen Stewart make the "A" List for great kissers. Bad celebrity kissers go back to the early days of film. When Vivien Leigh starred with Clark Gable in Gone with the Wind,&nbsp;she didn't like the kissing scenes, saying his dentures stank.&nbsp;Also, leading ladies used to dread kissing 1940's bad guy, Edward G. Robinson.</p><p>There is no doubt we want to believe the sexy images before us, but let's face it, just looking good up there doesn't make them great lovers. The complaints sometimes come from co-stars and sometimes former lovers wade in. The reasons? Sometimes, it's just plain old bad technique, while sometimes, bad breath or body odor factor in. Here are 15 (allegedly) bad celebrity kissers.</p><h2 id=kate-hudson---onion-breath>15. Kate Hudson - Onion Breath</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a title="Goldie Hawn Net Worth" href=#>Goldie Hawn's</a> little golden girl has made quite a splash in Hollywood, playing in a slew of movies, such as, How to Loose a Guy in 10 Days, The Skeleton Key,&nbsp;Almost Famous, Fool's Gold,&nbsp;Bride Wars and Something Borrowed, as well as received a string of award nominations. But when stand-up comedian and actor <a title="Dane Cook Net Worth" href=#>Dane Cook</a> was asked about his worst on-screen kiss, it didn't take him long to admit it one of his nominees was&nbsp;<a title="Kate Hudson Net Worth" href=#>Kate Hudson</a>. It was in the movie, &nbsp;My Best Friend's Girl. What was the&nbsp;problem? She apparently reeked of onion breath.</p><p></p><h2 id=bradley-cooper---wet>14. Bradley Cooper - Wet</h2><p>MTV proudly gave <a title="Bradley Cooper Net Worth" href=#>Bradley Cooper</a> and <a title="Jennifer Lawrence Net Worth" href=#>Jennifer Lawrence</a> a "Best Kiss" award in 2013, for their clinch in the 2012 film,&nbsp;Silver Linings Playbook. But Cooper admitted to UK's&nbsp;Daily Mail that&nbsp;while on set,&nbsp;Lawrence wasn't shy to&nbsp;call him out over his wet kissing habits (Cooper had to come with a flaw). They have since gone on to co-star in two other films, American Hustle and&nbsp;Serena together. Although, there is no word yet from Jennifer on whether or not&nbsp;Bradley has improved his infamous kissing technique. They must surely have something going for them. It is called box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=orlando-bloom-and-viggo-mortensen---b-o>13. Orlando Bloom and Viggo Mortensen - B.O.</h2><p>What do <a title="Viggo Mortensen Net Worth" href=#>Viggo Mortensen</a> and <a title="Orlando Bloom Net Worth" href=#>Orlando Bloom </a>have in common? Well, they made&nbsp;Lord of the Rings together. Also, reportedly, both have had a real problem with body odor. Some even say that Bloom wears the same clothes for a week and sleeps with his dog, and that Viggo didn't shower for weeks when they were filming the&nbsp;Lords franchise.&nbsp;According to The Guardian, Bloom's former girlfriend, Aussie model <a title="Miranda Kerr Net Worth" href=#>Miranda Kerr</a>, tired of stinky clinches, told him to clean up his act, or else. She's not around anymore. So, who knows?&nbsp;<a title="Keira Knightley Net Worth" href=#>Keira Knightley</a>, who co-starred with Bloom and <a title="Johnny Depp Net Worth" href=#>Johnny Depp</a> in Pirates of the Caribbean,&nbsp;did say that she preferred kissing Johnny Depp over Bloom.</p><p></p><h2 id=tom-cruise---icky>12. Tom Cruise - Icky</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a title="Tom Cruise Net Worth" href=#>Tom Cruise</a> is not only an action hero, he also has a soft side. At least in his films. Steamy love scenes in&nbsp;Mission Impossible with co-star <a title="Thandie Newton Net Worth" href=#>Thandie Newton</a> looked intense and passionate. However, according to Ms. Newton, she found the experience of kissing Cruise not very pleasant (she actually used the word icky). She also says that on days when kissing scenes were filmed, she went home complaining about how many takes she had to go through. She had a two year gap between 2000's&nbsp;Mission Impossible II&nbsp;and her next movie. Maybe someone wasn't too happy with her comments?</p><p></p><h2 id=brad-pitt---awkward-poor-hygiene>11. Brad Pitt - Awkward, Poor Hygiene</h2><p>To be fair to <a title="Brad Pitt Net Worth" href=#>Brad Pitt</a>, <a title="Kirsten Dunst Net Worth" href=#>Kirsten Dunst</a> was only 11 years old in 1994, when they kissed in the popular Vampire film,&nbsp;Interview with a Vampire,&nbsp;and he was some 18 years older than young Dunst. She has spoken about how awkward that kiss was, and called it "disgusting". She has also claimed that it was her first kiss, real or on screen. She has said back then, that Brad was kind of a hippie and cool. And let's not forget, there's also another point to factor in: Pitt is reportedly not crazy about showering, probably leading to stinky body odor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=leonardo-dicaprio---forgettable>10. Leonardo DiCaprio - Forgettable</h2><p>Before the Wolf of Wall Street Fame, Young and rising star&nbsp;<a title="Leonardo DiCaprio Net Worth" href=#>Leo DiCaprio</a> and Virginie Ledoyen&nbsp;played wannabe lovers in&nbsp;The Beach. In one of the scenes, one night, they swim out to sea and have an intense lip lock and make, what looks like passionate love, on the beach. What was Ledoyan's version? She can't even remember the passionate kiss and has said, while he is a nice guy, she wouldn't be interested to have&nbsp;him as a lover. That has got to hurt where it matters for the handsome star, then again, with the fame Leo has today, does it?</p><p></p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston---coffee-breath>9. Jennifer Aniston - Coffee Breath</h2><p><a title="Alec Baldwin Net Worth" href=#>Alec Baldwin</a> doesn't mince words. He says <a title="Jennifer Aniston Net Worth" href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> has extreme coffee breath. After kissing scenes with her on 30 Rock, he said,“every man who’s had to make out with her in TV and movies – I don’t know how they do it." He actually went as far as calling it "painful". <a title="Jason Bateman Net Worth" href=#>Jason Bateman</a>, who made&nbsp;The Switch&nbsp;and The Change-Up&nbsp;with her, reportedly halted a kissing scene because of her bad coffee breath. Someone would probably need to tell her about Dr. Howard Katz, a Los Angeles dentist who was dubbed, "the fresh breath guru to the stars."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=angelina-jolie---sweaty-and-bad-breath>8. Angelina Jolie - Sweaty and Bad Breath</h2><p><a title="Angelina Jolie Net Worth" href=#>Angelina Jolie</a>, X-Men star&nbsp;<a title="James McAvoy Net Worth" href=#>James McAvoy</a>, and <a title="Morgan Freeman Net Worth" href=#>Morgan Freeman</a>&nbsp;all starred together in&nbsp;Wanted,&nbsp;in 2008. McAvoy learns his father was a professional assassin and decides to chuck his boring desk job life and join in. Lots of action and a kissing scene or two with Jolie, who plays a female assassin. What did McAvoy think of kissing Jolie? Well, it was the first day of shooting and so "it was awkward, sweaty, and not very nice." But he did compliment her elsewhere, and said that she was in great shape. There is another problem: reportedly, her breath is so bad that Brad Pitt once gave her mints as a joke present for Valentine's Day.</p><p></p><h2 id=jason-segel---too-many-cigarettes>7. Jason Segel - Too Many Cigarettes</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star of the famed, popular TV series,&nbsp;How I Met Your Mother&nbsp;is, by all reports, a really nice guy. However, that is not the only thing reports say. <a title="Jason Segel Net Worth" href=#>Jason Segel's</a> co-star,&nbsp;<a title="Alyson Hannigan Net Worth" href=#>Alyson Hannigan</a>, who played the funny-man's&nbsp;wife on the series, refused to do kissing scenes with him. Why? Segel was a smoker, big time. Reports say that she could simply not stand the smell and the taste. Fortunately, he turned a bad thing into a good thing, and decided to quit smoking. The comedian even credits Hannigan with motivating him to quit the nasty habit.</p><p></p><h2 id=robert-pattinson---unpleasant>6. Robert Pattinson - Unpleasant</h2><p>Despite having won a string of MTV "Best Kiss" awards for his&nbsp;Twilight&nbsp;efforts with then main love,&nbsp;<a title="Kristen Stewart Net Worth" href=#>Kristen Stewart</a>, <a title="Robert Pattinson Net Worth" href=#>Robert Pattinson</a>&nbsp;has admitted he feels awkward doing love&nbsp;scenes in front of&nbsp;the camera. When he and <a title="Reese Witherspoon Net Worth" href=#>Reese Witherspoon</a> made&nbsp;Water for Elephants,&nbsp;the shooting schedule meant that they had to film a kissing scene while Rob was battling a stinking cold. Add to the fact that he felt awkward already, the fact that his nose was dripping on Witherspoon's wig, made it a very unpleasant experience for the pair (could we blame them?). She has used the word disgusting. Other co-stars have a different kind of complaint, and say Pattinson has a real body odor problem.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=matt-lanter---bad-kisser>5. Matt Lanter - Bad Kisser</h2><p><a title="Matt Lanter Net Worth" href=#>Matt Lanter </a>and <a title="AnnaLynne McCord Net Worth" href=#>AnnaLynne McCord</a> were boyfriend and girlfriend on TV's&nbsp;90210.&nbsp;We can't say that their characters, Liam Court and Naomi Clark, didn't look&nbsp;great together, but looks can certainly be deceiving, as there was a pretty big problem. McCord hated doing kissing scenes with the handsome Lanter. When asked about it, she just said,&nbsp;“You know, he actually is a really bad kisser, so it kind of sucks." That's gotta hurt! The handsome star was the voice of one of the characters on the&nbsp;Scooby Doo&nbsp;cartoon series. Luckily, there's no kissing going on there.</p><p></p><h2 id=ben-affleck---bad-breath>4. Ben Affleck - Bad Breath</h2><p>Rumor has it that when <a title="Ben Affleck Net Worth" href=#>Ben Affleck</a> and <a title="Sandra Bullock Net Worth" href=#>Sandra Bullock</a> made the romantic comedy,&nbsp;Forces of Nature,&nbsp;she gave him mints to cover up his reported halitosis. Whenever a list of stars who reportedly suffer from bad breath appears, Affleck is usually (if not always) on it. On the bright side,&nbsp;he's not the only one. Other A-listers with reportedly stinky breath include <a title="Hugh Grant Net Worth" href=#>Hugh Grant</a> and <a title="Beyonce Net Worth" href=#>Beyonce</a>. Rumor has it that at an Oscar ceremony, Grant's breath was so bad, that those around him were urging him to pop a few mints. Another rumor is that <a title="Nas Net Worth" href=#>Nas</a> once turned down a date with Beyonce because of her stinky breath.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=harrison-ford---bad-technique>3. Harrison Ford - Bad Technique</h2><p>Just like in any other work environment, it is important for co-workers to get along. Although&nbsp;<a title="Helen Mirren Net Worth" href=#>Helen Mirren</a> likes <a title="Harrison Ford Net Worth" href=#>Harrison Ford</a>, she does&nbsp;say that he is just a lousy kisser. She has said of her Mosquito Coast co-star, "He's probably not very good off-screen either. She does back herself up and admits that she isn't the only one who thinks this; other actresses reportedly agree. Whenever we get chatting off-screen and we get around to talking, we come to the same conclusion." Poor Calista. Luckily for Mr. Ford, great acting isn't defined by kissing.</p><p></p><h2 id=woody-allen---no-effort-at-all>2. Woody Allen - No Effort At All</h2><p><a title="Helena Bonham Carter Net Worth" href=#>Helena Bonham Carter</a>, who co-starred with <a title="Woody Allen Net Worth" href=#>Woody Allen</a> in the quirky 1995 film,&nbsp;Mighty Aphrodite,&nbsp;slammed Woody Allen's pucker power, saying that he makes no effort at all in kissing scenes, and also specifies that there can be no exchange of bodily fluid (aka saliva). This surely wasn't pleasant for Woody to hear, but to make matters worse, this was not the only time that Allen was criticized on his kissing abilities.&nbsp;When 16 year old <a title="Mariel Hemingway Net Worth" href=#>Mariel Hemingway</a> had a make out session with Allen in his 1979 movie&nbsp;Manhattan, she has recalled her horror and said, "We don't have to do that again, do we."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=shailene-woodley---strange-pills>1. Shailene Woodley - Strange Pills</h2><p><a title="Shailene Woodley Net Worth" href=#>Shailene Woodley</a>&nbsp;seems like she's&nbsp;been on a roll lately. The girl who was dubbed&nbsp;GQ Magazine's&nbsp;New Favorite Crush, followed up her popular roles in&nbsp;Divergent&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Fault in Our Stars&nbsp;with filming the futuristic adventure,&nbsp;Insurgent with co-star Miles Teller. Teller has actually commented on their kissing scenes in an earlier film,&nbsp;The Spectacular Now. As many of us are aware,&nbsp;Woodley is known for her healthy way, but that doesn't necessarily mean that this is a good thing for her co-stars. Teller&nbsp;has said that she is fond of taking some kind of Chinese remedy pill that makes her mouth taste like dirt and smell like, well, c**p.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqbV2Ysq2xwaugraGVqHqlwcGbnJ1lpJ2ybsPOq6qtZZuewLSx0axkoqZdnbytuNiwpqicXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./frugal-celebrities-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>10 Celebrities Who Live Surprisingly Frugal Lifestyles (&amp;amp; Their Net Worth)</span></a>
