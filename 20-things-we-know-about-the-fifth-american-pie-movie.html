It was a pretty groundbreaking comedy for its time, pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable further than we ever thought possible. Classic scenes from the film still&nbsp;are fresh in our minds, and it's hard to comprehend that multiple decades have passed since that first&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;movie came out. Because the film made such a huge impact on so many people, there are countless people just begging for another movie. And as it happens, they might just be getting their wish granted.</p><p>That's right, a&nbsp;fifth&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;movie has been pretty much confirmed. Endless rumors surrounding this sequel swirled over the last few years, but now it seems like we're finally getting some concrete, reliable information. The actors we all know and love are starting to speak about the possibility of a new film, and while they're not giving too much away, they're also starting to make the sequel seem more and more likely. But just what do we know about&nbsp;American Pie 5? What kind of movie will this be? What are the details? Here's everything that has been confirmed so far.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tara-reid-has-confirmed-its-existence-kind-of><strong>Tara Reid Has Confirmed Its Existence (Kind Of)</strong></h2><p>The&nbsp;fifth&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;movie has pretty much been confirmed, but fans can take further optimism from the fact that Tara Reid has talked about the film openly and enthusiastically. As quoted by&nbsp;<a href=#>Too Fab</a>,&nbsp;Tara Reid revealed:&nbsp;"I just saw them at one of the Emmy parties and was like, 'Come on guys, are we ever gonna do another one?' And they're like, 'It's happening.' I don't know if they're lying or not. That'd be fantastic, it'd be great." Tara Reid seems pretty convinced!</p><h2 id=jon-hurwitz-returns-as-the-writer><strong>Jon Hurwitz Returns As The Writer</strong></h2><p>One of the most heartening things about this potential sequel is the fact that it will feature the same writer as the original films, Jon Hurwitz. According to&nbsp;<a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the talented writer has already been confirmed as being on board the project, and fans will take a deep breath of relief upon hearing this news. The same writer means the same brand of comedy, and the same general tone that the original film did so well. Hurwitz has proved himself to be an extremely talented writer over the years.</p><h2 id=it-could-be-filmed-as-early-as-this-year><strong>It Could Be Filmed As Early As This Year</strong></h2><p>We've all seen it happen before with sequels –&nbsp;the movie is announced and then we have to wait 5 or more years before they even begin filming. With major studios like Universal, they have a list of things they want to get done, and movies like&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;5 often fall to the back of the queue. But according to a report by&nbsp;<a href=#>Kombini</a>, this movie could be filmed as early as 2018. This is all based off a quote they posted from Tara Reid. She explained:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It will be incredible to come back. American Pie is American Pie. The movies were a part of American culture, it's a classic. It is known all over the world. I'm very excited. It's going to be a great year for me, with Sharknado's debut and the possibility of filming yet another American Pie in 2018."</p><h2 id=apparently-the-script-was-written-5-years-ago><strong>Apparently The Script Was Written 5 Years Ago</strong></h2><p>Although this sequel might seem as if it has sprung up from nowhere, the truth might surprise you. According to an article by&nbsp;<a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, the script was written a whopping five years ago. The publication quoted&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;actor Thomas Ian Nicholas,&nbsp;who admitted:&nbsp;“That’s been sitting on a shelf at Universal collecting dust. There’s been a script for five years. Jon [Hurwitz] and Hayden [Schlossberg], who wrote and directed American Reunion, wrote it.&nbsp;Universal hired them to write it. I thought we were doing it the following year. That was the plan and then I didn’t hear anything.”</p><h2 id=sean-william-scott-is-up-for-a-sequel><strong>Sean William Scott Is Up For A Sequel</strong></h2><p>Without a doubt, if American Pie 5&nbsp;is to succeed, it must include the legendary character of Stifler. And it seems as though this could happen.&nbsp;According to an interview with <a href=#>Forbes</a>,&nbsp;Sean William Scott seems enthusiastic about a sequel, although he's also wary. He stated: "Honestly, I don't know. With these franchises you never know, you never can tell. It would be pretty funny to see Stifler in his 40s, still being the exact same guy, it could be hilarious. I've had some ideas but I don't know."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-imdb-page-for-the-movie-mentions-an-adventure-in-vegas><strong>The IMDB Page For The Movie Mentions An Adventure In Vegas</strong></h2><p>For a fifth movie in the franchise, it's vital that&nbsp;American Pie 5 doesn't tread the same ground as before. It must do something new&nbsp;– although that might be hard to actually construct. Because there's been so many past movies in the series, there's a sense that everything has already been done. But according to the movie's official&nbsp;IMDB&nbsp;page, it could be set in Vegas. Could we be seeing a movie similar to&nbsp;The Hangover? Tons of comedic movies have been set in the city that never sleeps, and it could make for a hilarious film.</p><h2 id=thomas-ian-nicholas-has-mentioned-the-movie-before><strong>Thomas Ian Nicholas Has Mentioned The Movie Before</strong></h2><p>One of the biggest stars of the first few&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;movies was Thomas Ian Nicholas. This was one of the main characters of the show, and one of the few that wasn't overly comedic. If&nbsp;American Pie 5&nbsp;is to succeed, it also needs to get this talented actor on board. But fans will take encouragement from the fact that Nicholas has spoken about it at length before. As previously mentioned, he's spoken about it to&nbsp;<a href=#>Us Weekly</a>. In that same interview, he also addressed the movie directly by saying:&nbsp;“Hopefully Disney doesn’t buy Universal and we get to make American Pie 5. I think there’s a chance. There’s always a chance. We never thought we were going to do the fourth one.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=strong-overseas-numbers-for-american-pie-reunion-made-the-new-movie-possible><strong>Strong Overseas Numbers For American Pie Reunion Made The New Movie Possible</strong></h2><p>American Reunion&nbsp;didn't do too well in domestic box offices. That's pretty much an established fact, and one that the studio and the actors acknowledge. Sean William Scott told&nbsp;<a href=#>Forbes</a>&nbsp;that the film went on to gross $140 million overseas.&nbsp;<a href=#>We Got This Covered</a>&nbsp;reported that the film went on to gross $233 million altogether. Those are strong numbers, and ones that Universal will find hard to ignore. Even though the film essentially flopped domestically, those international numbers are going to make&nbsp;American 5&nbsp;possible.</p><h2 id=director-hayden-schlossberg-is-on-board><strong>Director Hayden Schlossberg Is On Board</strong></h2><p>We've already mentioned one piece of amazing news&nbsp;– the same writer is on board for the new&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;movie. But that's only half of it&nbsp;– as the same director will also be joining the team. Fans of the series will be very familiar with the work of Hayden Schlossberg, and the fact that he's back on board is a great sign. Of course, he and writer Jon Hurwitz have worked together on tons of projects before, and they are one of the best comedic teams in the film industry. His talent behind the camera will ensure that&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;5&nbsp;will be a success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-with-stifler-s-mom-and-jason-s-dad-could-make-for-an-interesting-sequel><strong>What Happened With Stifler's Mom And Jason's Dad Could Make For An Interesting Sequel</strong></h2><p>American Reunion&nbsp;was a little bit of the "same old," but in many ways there were some amazing new developments. These developments could form the basis for major story elements in the next film. One of the most talked about things that happened in&nbsp;American Reunion (the most recent film) was the fact that Jason's dad and Stifler's mom got together. Nobody could have seen it coming, but it does make us wonder how this relationship will play out in&nbsp;American Pie 5.</p><h2 id=twitter-fans-have-made-pages-for-the-movie-calling-it-american-vacation><strong>Twitter Fans Have Made Pages For The Movie, Calling It "American Vacation"</strong></h2><p>We've already mentioned the fact that some signs point to a fifth movie being set in Vegas. This could be just rumors, but there are other factors which make a general "vacation movie" a plausible theme. Thomas Ian Nicholas further added fuel to these rumors when he was quoted by <a href=#>Fox News</a> as saying: "There’s been a lot of rumors online. Some fans have started Twitter pages called ‘American Vacation,’ pretending that it’s happening. I haven’t heard anything." Could this just be the ramblings of Twitter fans? Or is there some truth to this "American Vacation" theory?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-movie-is-a-bit-of-a-gamble-for-universal-studios><strong>The Movie Is A Bit Of A Gamble For Universal Studios</strong></h2><p>Even though&nbsp;American Pie 5&nbsp;did very well overseas, there's no denying the fact that Universal Studios is taking a little bit of a risk with another movie in this franchise. The sad truth is that numbers have been dropping as more and more&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;movies are made, and that could make for total flop. This is especially true in today's day and age of movies, where box office numbers are lower than they have ever been. As Sean William Scott told&nbsp;<a href=#>Forbes</a>: "I think the studio cooled on the idea of doing another American Pie because of that domestic take."</p><h2 id=kevin-and-vicky-probably-won-t-get-back-together><strong>Kevin And Vicky Probably Won't Get Back Together</strong></h2><p>One of the romances that have kept the&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;franchise alive after all these years is the on-and-off relationship between Kevin and Vicky. In more recent movies, we've seen these two slowly grow apart, although fans are still clamoring for these two highs school sweethearts to get back together. But actor Thomas Ian Nicholas (who plays Kevin) told&nbsp;<a href=#>Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;that fans shouldn't get their hopes up. He stated:&nbsp;“I think that’s what the fans really want but I think that would just be – I guess it would be cool but at the same time, does anyone really want to get back together with their high school sweetheart?” He did in college. In college, lots of people wanted that. But as adults, not so much.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-american-pie-franchise-will-turn-20-years-old-next-year><strong>The American Pie Franchise Will Turn 20 Years Old Next Year</strong></h2><p>Ready to feel old? Yes, that's right, the&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;franchise is now 20 years old. That movie that we all grew up watching is now considered a retro film, believe it or not. How times have changed. The original&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;movie is now one of the most iconic, classic 90s teen movies of all time, but a lot of our readers might feel like they saw it yesterday. It really puts things in perspective, and it reminds us just how much these actors have aged over the years.</p><h2 id=the-writing-and-directorial-team-are-also-behind-the-harold-and-kumar-franchise><strong>The Writing And Directorial Team Are Also Behind The Harold And Kumar Franchise</strong></h2><p>If fans are wondering whether or not directorial and writing duo Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg still have what it takes to make hilarious comedies, they need look no further than the&nbsp;Harold And Kumar franchise. Yes, that's right, the same writer and director who made the&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;franchise were also behind the hilarious films starring Kal Penn and John Cho. The fact that these movies were so universally loved and appreciated is a really good sign for any potential&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;sequel.</p><h2 id=sean-william-scott-has-some-interesting-ideas-for-a-sequel><strong>Sean William Scott Has Some Interesting Ideas For A Sequel</strong></h2><p>When asked about a potential new&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;sequel, Sean William Scott had a lot to say. He's already stated his ideas on the past movies and his thoughts about a new sequel, but what he told&nbsp;<a href=#>Forbes</a> was definitely bizarre&nbsp;– but very typical for an actor as hilarious and as wild as Sean William Scott. He stated: "Truthfully, I feel like Stifler did get his perfect revenge by&nbsp;[getting] with Finch's mom but it could still be really funny to see Stifler as this sad, male&nbsp;[dancer] just dancing for dollar bills."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=it-could-be-a-major-kick-start-for-some-of-the-actors-careers><strong>It Could Be A Major Kick Start For Some Of The Actors' Careers</strong></h2><p>It's no secret that many of the actors who appeared in the first&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;movies haven't had much success in the years since. There are of course a few exceptions, but many of the actors who seemed destined for great things have dwindled into relative obscurity. Of course, they still got the opportunity of a lifetime when working on such an amazing film, but they will undoubtedly be hoping to achieve more in the future. Another&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;sequel could be exactly what they need to kickstart their careers.</p><h2 id=writer-john-hurwitz-has-implied-that-it-could-be-a-long-way-off><strong>Writer John Hurwitz Has Implied That It Could Be A Long Way Off</strong></h2><p>While many online publications are reporting that&nbsp;American Pie 5&nbsp;is a sure thing, others seem to be offering conflicting information. One article from&nbsp;<a href=#>Comic Book</a>&nbsp;on August 9th of this year even quoted writer and director Jon Hurwitz as saying there were no plans for either&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;or&nbsp;Harold And Kumar&nbsp;sequels. His words might have been taken out of context to some extent, but it remains an unnerving report. According to the article, Jon Hurwitz revealed that he had "no immediate plans" for an&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;sequel during a Twitter Q&A.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sean-william-scott-just-booked-the-lethal-weapon-reboot><strong>Sean William Scott Just Booked The Lethal Weapon Reboot</strong></h2><p>After appearing in the original&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;film, Sean William Scott seemed destined to become one of the film industry's breakout stars. Although he did go on to book other important and defining roles, the actor himself will be the first to admit that his success did not quite live up to the initial expectations. But we're happy to report that his career going extremely well at the moment, and he's booked the lead role in the&nbsp;Lethal Weapon&nbsp;reboot. This is great news for the new&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;sequel, because it means Sean William Scott will go into it feeling optimistic, and he won't be rusty from long periods without work.</p><h2 id=fans-are-a-little-concerned-about-tara-reid-after-a-bizarre-interview-about-sharknado><strong>Fans Are A Little Concerned About Tara Reid After A Bizarre Interview About Sharknado</strong></h2><p>Tara Reid is another star from the original film who went on to experience notable success, although she too didn't quite reach the levels she was hoping for. That being said, she is still a working actress, and today Tara Reid is best known for the&nbsp;Sharknado&nbsp;series, which has a massive following. But fans were a little concerned after she gave an interview on&nbsp;Today. According to&nbsp;<a href=#>Meaww</a>, fans expressed shock and confusion on social media after Tara Reid slurred her words and seemed to be a little "out of it." Maybe this isn't such great news for an&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;sequel...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>References:&nbsp;<a href=#>wegotthiscovered.com</a>, <a href=#>hollywoodreporter.com</a>, <a href=#>toofab.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>kombini.com</a>, <a href=#>usmagazine.com</a>, <a href=#>movieweb.com</a>, <a href=#>forbes.com</a>, <a href=#>foxnews.com</a>, <a href=#>meaww.com</a>, <a href=#>comicbook.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e5FpZK2gmaO0tHnWnmSkpp%2BseqKuzq6rZqyYmnqntcWtn2aZnZq%2Fqq%2FAp2SpoZViurDCyJ5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./black-friday-deals-kohls-cyber-week-sale-holiday-shopping.html><span>←</span><span>17 Best Black Friday Deals From Kohl's Up to 75% Off</span></a>
