I’m not yelling, so I’ll stop right now. Okay? I apologize, but I was under a lot of pressure. “Please,” she implores.</p><p>The woman “thought she was going to be rude to me and Mason,” she wrote afterward. So much for her getting home today.</p><p>Michael Thomas, a spokesman for Delta, stated that Peirez’s actions did not reflect the airline’s expectations of its customers.</p><p>Thomas, the company’s spokesperson, issued a statement asking passengers to “embrace civility and respect one another” while in the air.&nbsp;</p><p>We thank our Endeavour Air flight attendant for her dedication to Delta’s values and apologize to the other passengers on Flight 4017 for their negative experience.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Susan Peirez is suspended from her job</h2><p>She can stop stressing about her status at the New York State Council on the Arts because she has been advised not to report for duty while her bosses evaluate the situation.</p><p>“State employees are and should be pushed to the highest level both on the job and personally.” said Ronni Reich, head of government communications for the Council.&nbsp;</p><p>Where Peirez works as a program director. “State employees are pushed to the highest level both professionally and personally,” added Ronni Reich.</p><p>We’ve been made aware of the matter and are now looking into it. Until the investigation is complete, this individual has been removed from duty and placed on leave, Reich said.&nbsp;</p><p>Marissa Rundell, 19, was seen on video with her eight-month-old son Mason on the JFK to Syracuse, New York trip when Peirez boarded the plane and promptly caused chaos.</p><p>I was in the second-to-last row of the plane, and she got on right before I did,” Rundell explained.&nbsp;</p><p>She slammed her bags on the floor towards the rear. This is f****** ridiculous, she exclaimed. Having to sit in the plane’s rear is a major pain.&nbsp;</p><p>Rundell, a New York native, claimed that she was ‘ignored’ by Peirez when she requested that she could not use profanity around Mason and Peirez still didn’t look her way as she proceeded to vent her frustrations.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC%2F1KyYp2WgmrazsdlmrqGZpGK1orzPnqWenF2pvG60xKtm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-was-susan-casey-montana-missing-murder-case-in-details.html><span>←</span><span>Who Was Susan Casey Montana?
