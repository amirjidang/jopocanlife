For her, bringing those characters to life and capturing the visions of several writers and directors served as her rise to fame; a few of her notable roles that would go on to define her career were written by him. Diane Keaton and Woody Allen would not only help define the film industry in their respective ways, but the duo would also be known for their contributions to cinema of which they created alongside one another. Keaton and Allen were best known for starring together in two of Allen's most famous films, 1977's Annie Hall, and Manhattan, which would follow two years later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their story would not only be defined by their notable friendship and their career-defining roles but for the rocky romance, which would be deeply impactful for both Allen and Keaton. The former couple's brief relationship is largely overshadowed by their professional, working relationship, but regardless of how their relationship has panned out over the last five decades, fierce loyalty remains the pillar of the relationship which has been discussed and analyzed greatly over the years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Diane Keaton Offers Her Fashion Expertise On How To Wear A Belt</a></span></p><h2 id=woody-and-diane-the-first-chapter>Woody And Diane: The First Chapter</h2><p>Allen and Keaton delivered multiple intimate performances on screen, with their lives off-camera being no exception. When Keaton <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sat down</a> with Katie Couric many years later, the actress wasted no time in revealing the nature of their relationship, revealing "I had a huge crush on Woody right from the moment I saw him."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keaton's initial draw to Allen is unknown, but it is clear she was about to be immersed in&nbsp;multiple aspects of his artistry and personality. The pair's first project together was Play It Again, Sam, released in 1972. Looking back at her casting in Allen's play, Keaton laughs and jokingly attributes winning her role in the play to the height difference between the pair. Keaton's height was taken and she didn't exceed Allen's five foot seven frame!</p><p>Neurosis&nbsp;would not only define Allen's notably distinct writing style but would also go on to define parts of his relationship with his on-screen muse. The attraction was mutual and the pair would go on to start dating off-screen. The relationship grew to be serious, where the couple would move in together. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According</a> to Yahoo, the duo was romantically involved for five years, before they parted ways in 1974.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hearts-on-the-mend>Hearts On The Mend</h2><p>Heartbreak wouldn't have a hand in shaping the story between Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. In fact, unexpected triumph would go on to define a sizable section of their story. Three years after the couple split up, Allen would go on to direct Keaton in the film many note to be his magnum opus, Annie Hall.&nbsp;In the film, which Allen also wrote, he would play Alvy Singer, an extremely neurotic and insecure fellow, who would put the titular character on a pedestal, looking for answers within her and their crumbling relationship, displaying the dangers of putting an unrealistic expectation on a partner. Keaton would go on to win an Oscar for her performance in the film.</p><p>In a case of art imitating life, Alvy and Annie's relationship does not last. Allen and Keaton's ability to put aside any potential animosity from the fallout of their own relationship in order to maintain the health of their professional relationship makes the rare insight we do know about the nature of the former couple's real-life relationship all the more believable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebrities Who Are Best Friends With Their Exes</a></span></p><p>The private nature of Allen and Keaton's romantic relationship was kept mum for many years until Keaton released her memoir, which, according to Yahoo, would include a frank description of where Keaton was at mentally while she was dating Allen.</p><p>Keaton was faced with an extremely serious eating disorder, which understandably consumed a great deal of her life. She would opt to deal with the grim reality of bulimia instead of going out with Allen. He would go on to play a vital role in Keaton's recovery from the disease; he "Sent [Keaton] to a psychoanalyst to help her with her insecurity," despite having no idea his girlfriend had been sick.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=friendship-springs-eternal>Friendship Springs Eternal</h2><p>The pair's relationship would go on to flourish professionally as they appeared on-screen together in Manhattan, which would go on to conclude Allen's extremely lucrative decade. After going on to direct more notable works in the Eighties, he and Keaton would triumphantly appear on the screen once more in 1993 as they continued to honor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the place </a>bringing them together on film, in Manhattan Murder Mystery.</p><p>The Nineties would turn out to be a turning point for Allen, both professionally and personally. In 1992,&nbsp;it would be revealed Allen allegedly had been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">acting inappropriately toward his seven-year-old daughter, Dylan</a>. Her mother Mia Farrow would <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">come forward </a>to Vanity Fair, detailing the situation.</p><p>Allen's public perception would go on to be defined by scandal up until this day, but one name in his camp would attempt to clear the air. His former colleague and forever friend Diane Keaton would go on to continuously stand by him. She would refuse to elaborate on the situation in interviews, opting to continuously&nbsp;answer "I believe my friend."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate Winslet & 9 Other Celebrities Who Regret Working With Woody Allen</a></span></p><p>It is rare for a friendship to transcend through time, impacted by both fact and fiction while continuing&nbsp;to play such a&nbsp;strong role in one another's narratives decades later, but Diane Keaton and Woody Allen's relationship like their film roles together has never been conventional, a consultation from lobsters and/or a giant spider, optional.</p><p>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Publisher Drops Woody Allen's Memoir, “Apropos of Nothing.”</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr%2BmrculsGagkaW9prrEnWSbnaSssqa6jJ2gmqaVYrimrdOopWaZnpl6uLvOnbBmmZyhsq97</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./outlander-what-cast-members-have-revealed-about-the-show.html><span>←</span><span>What Cast Members Have Revealed About The Show</span></a>
