The show followed the lives of Heidi, her then bestie, Lauren Conrad, and their inner circle of friends, which included Whitney Port, Brody Jenner, and Audrina Patridge, to name a few.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Heidi and Lauren managed to share a few years of friendship, the duo ended things when Montag began dating bad boy, Spencer Pratt. This was the catalyst to <a href=#>LC and Heidi's feud</a>, which became one of the biggest reality TV storylines to date. Luckily for Heidi, she managed to make a name for herself outside of her feud with Conrad, however, things took a massive turn when it was revealed she'd <a href=#>undergone 10 plastic surgery procedures</a> in one day!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Heidi Montag Is Still Talking About Her Feud With Lauren Conrad</a></span></p><p>The news shocked fans across the world, and it was only a matter of time before Heidi would speak out regarding the controversy when it came to her transformation. Well, turns out her interview with Access Hollywood's Billy Bush didn't go over all too well, and as fans look back at it today, there's a few problems they've pointed out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=heidi-montag-39-s-transformation>Heidi Montag's Transformation</h2><p>The world was shocked when Heidi graced the cover of People magazine back in January 2010 revealing her new look followed by the headline, "Addicted To Plastic Surgery". Her transformation could have been life-threatening, considering <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she had 10 procedures</a> done in a single sitting.</p><p>The star revealed her look on-screen to her family back in Crested Butte, Colorado, where her mother, Darlene, struggled with accepting her daughter's new face. Considering how drastic a change Heidi underwent, it's no surprise that her family, even her hubby, Spencer Pratt, who hasn't always been the best influence, found it a tough pill to swallow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During her time under the knife, Heidi had her back re-shaped, her chin shaved down, ears pinned back, eyebrows lifted, lips injected, fat put into her cheeks, her nose done, and inner and outer liposuction. While this all sounds wild, well, it is, Heidi by today's standards, didn't look too wild.</p><h2 id=was-heidi-montag-shamed-by-billy-bush>Was Heidi Montag Shamed By Billy Bush?</h2><p>Heidi revealed the long list of procedures she had done during her 2010 interview with Billy Bush on Access Hollywood. Although being open about her plastic surgery was not something celebrities were so open about a decade ago, Heidi masterfully used it as a driving force for her career.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Heidi And Spencer Went Broke</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the era of the Kardashians, where BBL's, nose jobs, lip injections, fillers, botox, and a plethora of cosmetic procedures that celebs undergo today, it's evident plastic surgery isn't nearly as frowned upon as it once was. During her interview, Heidi was asked if she was happy with how she looked now, and whether she was done with plastic surgery. "I feel that way now! I really do feel that way," Heidi said in response to if she's happy with how she looks. Billy then asked Heidi if she was done, leading Heidi to make it clear that she would be having "nothing" more done. "But you're addicted to plastic surgery, Heidi!" Billy said as he lifted the People magazine cover.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Heidi gracefully revealed how lucky she was to have had the access to such groundbreaking procedures, and while the list of surgeries she had done sounds alarming, Heidi looked then, how every celeb looks now. Fans were quick to call out Billy for his incessant questioning and shaming, despite going under the knife being such a trivial thing today.</p><p>Billy then poked fun at what Heidi might look like when she's older, pointing to the fact that she might be 80 but look 50 and not appear as natural as others would her age. Heidi didn't let the remark phase her, sticking by her choices and making it clear that she's the happiest she's ever been.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>15 Photos Showing What Heidi Montag Is Up To Today</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYq6zsYyup6ydpGLEqsDHZpmipJyueqPB0qFkqK6Vp3q1tMisZKGdmZm2brnOp6uan12eu7Wx0a%2Bgnq9f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./faith-hill-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Faith Hill Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
