The announcement follows Piqué’s highly public breakup from Shakira in June 2022 after 11 years of marriage amid allegations of infidelity, <a href=#>which may have led to a boost in her career</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that his new partner was noticeably younger, a PR student, and wholly unconnected to a life in Hollywood, it was understandable that the media went into overdrive attempting to explain Piqué’s new relationship.</p><h2 id=clara-chia-marti-took-a-break-from-social-media-to-avoid-the-negative-press>Clara Chia Marti Took A Break From Social Media To Avoid The Negative Press</h2><p>Clara Chia Marti hasn't been active on social media in a while. Despite making a brief appearance on Instagram, she quickly vanished again.</p><p>Marti was seen on the patio of Shakira and Piqué’s former residence when their relationship had just begun. The pictures quickly spread online, <a href=#>inciting outrage from Shakira supporters</a>.</p><p>Marti returned to Instagram at that point, although she had a private account. However, as her images from the terrace went viral, she promptly deleted her social media accounts. It appears that she preferred to stay away from any interactions with the press or fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/6-6.png><p>Even Shakira has <a href=#>taken some shots at her and Piqué via diss tracks</a> that she dropped last January 2023, the same month that Piqué posted an Instagram photo of her.</p><p>Her music lyrics contain lines like "I'm worth two 22-year-olds," and "I wish you the best with my supposed replacement, you swapped a Ferrari for a Twingo. You swapped a Rolex for a Casio."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is Worth More: Gerard Piqué Or Shakira?</a></span></p><p>"I wouldn't go back to you, even if you cried or begged me," she said.

She also refuses to give interviews or make any public comments about the relationship. I think we can guess why.</p><h2 id=clara-chia-marti-needed-psychological-treatment-to-deal-with-the-pressure-of-her-relationship-with-gerard-piqu-eacute>Clara Chia Marti Needed Psychological Treatment To Deal With The Pressure Of Her Relationship With Gerard Piqué</h2><p>According to a Spanish journalist, Clara Chia Marti, the girlfriend of Barcelona defender Gerard Piqué, had to receive psychological care.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Roberto Antolin said during a Spanish-to-English translation on the program Mitre Live, “Marti is in the middle of psychological treatment. She is not having a good time, and the constant media watch is taking its toll. Clara is a person who is not part of the media world and suddenly she got involved. She doesn't feel at ease or comfortable.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2-10.png><p>The journalist went on to say that Shakira apparently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gave her ex-lover's partner the nickname "little dead fly"</a> (mosquita muerta), according to reports. It is a Spanish expression that means to say that a person is innocent above suspicion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finally, he disclosed that the student was still having mental difficulties as a result of Shakira's full diss track. Fans of the pop star have been vocal in their disapproval of their relationship at every turn, including during quiet dinners.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Burned Twice? Shakira's Breakup From Gerard Piqué Is Eerily Similar To Another Split</a></span></p><p>A dinner date between Piqué and Marti a few months back ended unexpectedly. When the restaurant owner saw them, he demanded that they leave immediately. It didn't take long for him to reveal that Shakira was one of his favorite artists.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1-11.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Gerard Romero posted on YouTube, Piqué discussed mental health and its effects on sanity, suggesting that he was unaware of Shakira's attacks. He said, “It reached a point where if I had let things get to me, I would have thrown myself off a cliff.”</p><p>“Now we dedicate ourselves to throwing this beef, and then the other one... And I don’t want to go into it because it’s a personal issue,” he continued, saying it may appear to be fun and games, but individuals fail to consider the implications for mental health.</p><p>Piqué commented on how it has become "fashionable" to criticize others, an activity that always attracts anonymous admirers.</p><h2 id=gerard-piqu-eacute-filed-a-restraining-order-against-a-journalist-who-supported-shakira>Gerard Piqué Filed A Restraining Order Against A Journalist Who Supported Shakira</h2><p>Marti was apparently subjected to public humiliation after Shakira released her breakup anthems in which she not only disparaged her boyfriend but also his girlfriend, causing her fans to humiliate Marti every time she stepped outdoors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Piqué has declared victory after preventing a paparazzo who publicly supports his ex-wife, Shakira, from approaching his new girlfriend within 400 meters of her. Interestingly, he put up a fight to protect his girlfriend but <a href=#>easily gave up custody of his children</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/3-8.png><p>According to Marca Magazine, the girlfriend of the former Barcelona player filed a complaint against journalist Jordi Martin, claiming that he has caused her "intense anguish."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Gerard Piqué And Shakira’s Relationship Had A Fiery End, But What Was The Start Of Their Love Story Like?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Martin's behavior, according to the PR student, has been "aggressive, burdensome, intrusive, and provocative" since she began dating Piqué. She requested a 1000-meter restraining order from the journalist, but the court barred him from approaching Marti within 400 meters, with the exception of social occasions.</p><p>Even though Martin is a journalist, the court ruled that he cannot cause "unjustifiable suffering" to anyone, even Marti. As a result, the court ordered the paparazzo not to come within 20 meters of her friends or relatives and not to speak to Marti for three months.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/4-9.png><p>According to the judge, three months is "possibly sufficient" for the young woman "to recover" and "perhaps, for her to definitively lose media interest." We don’t know about that one!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There was a full-scale attack on Marti and Piqué because the journalist claimed she had cheated on her boyfriend when she met Piqué, and he had to intervene to stop it.</p><p>We can only hope that the media eases up on these two, but in the interest of full disclosure, we know that won't happen anytime soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbaledKhmKShopZ6psSMoJyrmaKZerG10K6cZpmemXqotdGlnauhlaOxbq%2FLmqmaZZOdtqJ5zJqpraFdna6vsMueZKybkaOxorjOrqpmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heres-what-we-know-about-wwes-titan-towers.html><span>←</span><span>Here's What We Know About WWEs Titan Towers</span></a>
