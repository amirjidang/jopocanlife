She was basically canceled after agreeing with a certain statement made Piers Morgan against Meghan Markle. Suddenly, <a href=#>she was viewed as racist,</a> and she felt the wrath of both fans and media.</p><p>“They were saying they were going to come in the night, cut my throat, cut [my husband] Ozzy’s throat, cut my dogs’ throats,” she recalled. “I said, ‘I ain’t going out, I ain’t doing anything.’ I just couldn’t stop crying because all I was thinking about was all the things that I’ve gone through in my life, and now they’re calling me a racist, this is insanity.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The Real Reason Sharon Osbourne And Ozzy Osbourne Have Quit Hollywood</a></span></p><p>These days, Sharon is keeping a low profile, and trying to better herself with ketamine therapy after her ‘The Talk’ exit.</p><p>Turns out, Sharon was going through more than just career and personal struggles. As if that wasn't bad enough, Osbourne underwent a tough cosmetic procedure, one that she was not content.</p><p>Let's find out how it all went down and why Osbourne decided to get the surgery in the first place.</p><h2 id=sharon-osbourne-s-october-cosmetic-procedure-was-a-disaster>Sharon Osbourne's October Cosmetic Procedure Was A Disaster</h2><p>So what happened during Sharon Osbourne's surgery? Well, before we discuss the botched procedure, we should discuss why it took place to begin with. According to Sharon, she decided to do work on her face years ago, for the simple fact that she wanted to look better. According to her words alongside Daily Mail, <a href=#>she did it for herself and nobody else.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"'For me,' she says quickly. 'Just look at pictures of me from 25 years ago. I was totally out of condition, 230lb in weight and a not very good-looking woman. "</p><p>"Somebody you'd pass in the street. I was at a gig and there were these girls at the side of the stage and one of them said to me, 'Oh, are you Ozzy's mother?' I do it for me. Not anyone else."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Was Sharon Osbourne The Real Reason Marie Osmond Left 'The Talk'?</a></span></p><p>As far as her cosmetic surgery in October goes, <a href=#>the procedure was a complete disaster</a>, lasting more than five hours. When she saw the result, Sharon was not pleased and neither was her family.</p><p>"I looked like one of those f****ng mummies that they wrap (with bandages)."</p><p>"I'm telling you, it was horrendous. (To the surgeon) I'm, like, 'You've got to be f**king joking.' One eye was different to the other. I looked like a f****ng Cyclops."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ozzy would also chime in, stating that he didn't care how much it cost, Sharon needed to get the work redone.</p><p>Ultimately, it was not a good result but according to Sharon, this wasn't the first time she wasn't content with cosmetic work on her face.</p><h2 id=it-wasn-t-the-first-time-they-botched-sharon-osbourne-s-face>It Wasn't The First Time They Botched Sharon Osbourne's Face</h2><p>Sharon has been honest about her procedures, and that included a 2019 facelift. Looking back, once again Sharon wasn't thrilled with how it all went down, especially given that her face went completely numb, and she couldn't feel her face. She revealed the details on 'The Kelly Clarkson Show'.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I had this thing where they lifted up my mouth and then for the first like week I'm like I couldn't feel my mouth, I can hardly feel my mouth now, to be honest with you."</p><p>"I couldn't find my mouth. It was numb and it was up on one side and I looked like Elvis and all the kids and Ozzy are going, 'Why are you snarling at me?' And I'm like, 'I'm not snarling; I'm not doing anything!'"</p><p>Here's to hoping Osbourne can get things back to her liking, along with making a return to TV in some capacity.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Sharon Osbourne To Expose Ozzy's Cheating In New Book</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8br%2FHmqmopl2kwKO71Kulnqtdm66ksY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./was-jennifer-connelly-in-the-original-top-gun.html><span>←</span><span>Was Jennifer Connelly in the original Top Gun?</span></a>
