How much does he make and from doing what? Here's what Penn Badgley's net worth looks like in 2021.</p><h2 id=penn-badgley-39-s-start-in-the-entertainment-business><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Penn Badgley's Start In The Entertainment Business</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before fans saw his face in movies and TV, Badgley was doing voice over work. He did the voices for the video games "Mario Golf 64" and "Mario Tennis 64" in 1999 and 2000. Badgley had guest starred in a few shows including Will and Grace, Daddio, The Brothers of Garcia and What I Like About You.</p><p>The actor got his first major recurring role on the soap opera The Young and the Restless as Phillip Chancellor from 2000 to 2001.

He went on to star in John Tucker Must Die, The Fluffer, Debating Robert Lee, Drive-Thru, The Nightmare Room, The Twilight Zone and Forever Strong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Badgley's first main roles came in the series Do-Over, The Mountain and The Bedford Diaries.

He earned the role of Dan Humphrey in Gossip Girl, in which he appeared in all six seasons. Gossip Girl's audience was never that big, but it had a huge cultural impact. Dan Humphrey was not one of the rich kids, at least until his dad got remarried. His character was portrayed well and very popular with fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=music-career><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Music Career</span></h2><p>Aside from acting, Badgley has also earned his money through a music career. When Gossip Girl ended in 2012, he switched gears and turned to music. The actor joined friends Jimmy Giannopoulos, Simon Oscroft, and Darren Will and they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">formed the band, MOTHXR</a>. It started out as a passion project, but people soon took an interest in it. The band was signed with Washington Square in 2015 and then toured around the world. Between touring and releasing music, Badgley earned a good amount of money from this aspect of his career.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>20 Facts About Penn Badgley That Fans Of YOU Tend To Ignore</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-time-on-39-you-39><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>His Time On 'You'</span></h2><p>You has captured audiences' attention around the world. Since Badgley is the lead character of the show, he most likely earns the most money amongst the cast, although it is not clear on how much. If the show does good this season, it could earn him a pretty penny. Season 4 will premiere next year and also add to his net worth. You is a psychological thriller series which follows Joe Goldberg who has a dark past and is a straight up serial killer.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Penn Badgley And 14 Other Celebs Expecting A Baby In 2020</a></span></p><h2 id=his-current-net-worth><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>His Current Net Worth</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Currently, <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> puts his net worth at $8 million</a> for 2021.
