The 40-year-old professional boxer is practically made of gold. So far, his fortune has jumped over $565,000,000 – and boy, does he know how to spend it! From exclusive watch collections to supercars, Floyd Mayweather’s apparently making the most of his lavish lifestyle. Speaking of which, he’s already disclosed about his car collection to the world. On January 5, 2015, Mr. MoneyMaker tweeted out a photo of his private jet alongside a fabulous collection of exotic vehicles, screaming “I’m rich!” Indeed, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Floyd Mayweather</a> has always loved the extravagant side of life - and his regular demonstrations of affluence can totally prove it. During one of his training sessions in LA, Floyd Mayweather showed off another gorgeous member of his pricey car collection: a badass $4.8million (£3.1m) silver Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the record, his fantastic CCXR Trevita was parked next to his Ferrari and his three Bugatti Veyrons! Now you must be wondering how in the world Floyd owns all of these insane vehicles. Well, two of his most preferred auto dealers must have been asking the same question all these years. All joking aside, Floyd Mayweather is believed to have bought over 100 cars for the last 18 years, 35 of which he got from the famous auto dealer, Obi Keke. Also, a great percentage of the vehicles, which he’s purchased from Josh Towbin, was eventually given away or sold for a "modest" amount of money. Indeed, this speaks volumes about Floyd’s fortune that seems to be growing by the second. From the unique Bugatti Grand Sport to his insane Rolls Royces, today we bring you 15 of the most luxury vehicles in Floyd’s garage that cost a whole fortune!</p><h2 id=bugatti-grand-sports-chassis-088-matte-white-worth-3-000-000>Bugatti Grand Sports Chassis 088 Matte White Worth $3,000,000</h2><p>According to one of his trusted auto dealers, there’s just no room for mediocrity when dealing with The MoneyMaker. Originally, Keke started out as a Chevrolet dealer but quickly changed the direction of his ambitions. It wasn’t long before he moved on to managing stores for the world’s top car manufacturers, such as Mercedes Benz, Lexus, Ferrari, etc. Keke sees Floyd as an unpredictable guy who may even call you in the wee hours of the night, like it's no big deal. This is actually how he got one of his priceless Bugatti Veyrons. When asked about Floyd’s expensive car habits, Keke recalls how the boxer purchased one of his Veyrons. Apparently, the unwavering champ had a special mission for his trusted auto dealer: Floyd wanted to add another flashy member to his fabulous fleet of luxury cars. In Keke’s 30-year-old career, he’s sold over 39 cars to Floyd Mayweather, three of which were Bugatti Veryons. For instance, his Bugatti Sports Chassis 008 is allegedly worth around $3,000,000! Indeed, this is exactly how wealthy Floyd Mayweather is!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bugatti-veyron-chassis-116-white-over-soft-silver-worth-1-600-000>Bugatti Veyron Chassis 116 White Over Soft Silver&nbsp;Worth $1,600,000</h2><p>The undefeated boxer has always been open when it comes to his luxury lifestyle. Thanks to his social media accounts, which he mostly uses for showing off his exclusive cars, his fans are able to witness the constant expansion of his car collection. It's clear that Floyd is a die-hard fan of Bugatti as he currently owns a gorgeous silver Chassis 116 that's worth a whopping $1,600,000. Indeed, that's one hell of a car! He not only has a rare fleet of luxury supercars, including a Bugatti Veyron Chassis 1616, but he's also a proud owner of a private jet, which he dubs AirMayweather. Well, Floyd Mayweather has an obvious sense of humor. But apart from his flashy personality, Mr. Moneymaker absolutely deserves such a fortunate life. After all, he's the undefeated boxing champion, remember? Even cocky rivals like Conor McGregor didn't succeed in taking the crown off his head.</p><h2 id=bugatti-veyron-chassis-101-black-metallic-red-metallic-worth-1-600-000>Bugatti Veyron Chassis 101 Black Metallic/Red Metallic&nbsp;Worth $1,600,000</h2><p>Another exciting supercar that can be spotted in Floyd's unique car collection is the mind-blowing Bugatti Veyron Chassis 101. This particular model is said to cost around $1,600,000 so it absolutely deserves a place on this list. If we must describe his Veyron Chassis 101 with 1 world only, it'll certainly be exceptional. Not only does it impress with its supreme looks, but its road performance can really challenge the mighty force of luxury cars, like Ferrari or Porsche. From its deluxe interior design to the fierce roaring sound of the engine, this car is certainly the dream of any car enthusiast, like the boxer himself. But unlike many other celebs, Floyd Mayweather owns a few of them like a real boss.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=floyd-just-can-t-stop-buying-rolls-royces-and-his-rolls-royce-coup-is-spectacular>Floyd Just Can't Stop Buying Rolls Royces (And His Rolls Royce Coupé Is Spectacular)</h2><p>According to Josh Towbin - the same auto dealer who sold him more than 100 cars in a span of 18 years - Floyd Mayweather just can't resist the sight of a glossy vehicle. Over the years, Mayweather's personal collection of fancy vehicles has welcomed around 16 Rolls Royces. No, it's hardly a joke, guys. With a net worth of $565 million, Floyd can afford the luxury of having all those Rolls Royces, including two Rolls-Royce Drophead Coupes as well. By the way, each sells for £367,000/$510,000. Apparently, the boxing champ has a thing for flamboyant vehicles and his passion for unique cars doesn't seem to go away anytime soon. When asked about his most favorite client, Josh shared that Floyd isn't a fan of the typical payment methods. In fact, he likes driving around in his fancy cars loaded with duffel bags filled with cash, lots of cash.</p><h2 id=his-garage-even-houses-two-rolls-royce-phantoms-what>His Garage Even Houses Two Rolls Royce Phantoms! What?!</h2><p>Nothing evokes better images of luxury and extravagance quite like the sight of Floyd’s Rolls Royce Phantoms. If you’re fond of British luxury cars, look no further than the fabulous Rolls Royce Phantom. As iconic as it is, this particular vehicle excites with its unique looks and deluxe interior design. Not only does it offer all the luxury in the world, but it’s a beautiful handmade vehicle. Maybe this is exactly what made Floyd fall in love with this fancy car that’s estimated at $410,000. Quite a price, isn’t it? His $410,000 vehicle comes with a wide range of deluxe amenities that promise a smooth first-class ride. Floyd’s Rolls Royce Phantom boasts 0-60 time of 5.7 seconds to boot, 6.8L V12 with 453 hp and 531 lb-ft of torque. Frankly, it’s not that powerful as the ‘less expensive' Ghost version. However, when you buy a Phantom, it’s never about the power.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=take-a-look-at-his-rolls-royce-ghost-worth-209-000>Take A Look At His Rolls Royce Ghost&nbsp;Worth $209,000</h2><p>Yes, he has a Rolls Royce Ghost as well. Doesn't he ever get tired of his Rolls Royces? Well, you'd better ask him, not us. As famous as he is, the boxing champion allegedly funneled a whopping $209,000 into this priceless vehicle. In a span of 18 years, Floyd Mayweather had the privilege to drive around in 16 unique Rolls Royces! Well, it's crystal clear that Floyd Mayweather is a great fan of the brand as he's particularly fond of the Ghost model that’s still worth a whole fortune. In 2017, The MoneyMaker disclosed his gorgeous fleet of vehicles to his fans and they were simply mind-blown by his luxury lifestyle, including a heaven-like mansion in Miami. The famous boxer has been living the life of his dreams which definitely includes a Rolls Royce Ghost. When you’re a guy like Floyd Mayweather, you just never think about the price of such luxury things. Isn't that right, Floyd?</p><h2 id=the-insane-rolls-royce-wraith-he-bought-for-his-daughter-for-360-000>The Insane Rolls Royce Wraith He Bought For His Daughter For $360,000</h2><p>One of the perks of being filthy rich is the financial ability to purchase everything you want – even if that means buying an insane Rolls Royce Wraith for your teenage girl. Isn’t that a little too much for a 14-year-old girl? Well, it may sound kind of crazy but Floyd really surprised his lovely daughter with a brand-new Rolls Royce Wraith. As a parent, he probably thinks that this is the perfect way to bring some joy into her life. So now that his net worth goes around $565,000,000, he must’ve felt the desire to spoil her more than ever. Well, it's still possible that his only wish was to expand the family collection of fine cars by adding another fabulous Rolls Royce to it. Whatever the case, this particular vehicle is definitely an unusual gift for a teenager.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=floyd-s-mclaren-650s-will-blow-you-away>Floyd's McLaren 650S Will Blow You Away</h2><p>Although McLaren 650S shares a few features with the company’s hit MP4-12C, it’s actually quite a fascinating model. With the end of MP4-12 C production, the giant car manufacturer decided to replace it with a brand-new concept – the 650 S. Well, it still may use the same chassis and type of engine, however, Floyd’s McLaren 650S is considerably lighter without compromising the road performance. As a car enthusiast, Floyd was apparently aware of the 641 hp combined with a twin-turbocharged V8 motor that really makes it one hell of a vehicle. Well, Floyd’s 650S may not be as fast as his punches in the octagon but it still is an impressive vehicle to own in your garage. According to one of his most preferred auto dealers, Floyd may buy a new fancy vehicle at any second without a hint of hesitation.</p><h2 id=take-a-look-at-his-unique-ferrari-458-spider-that-s-drop-dead-beautiful>Take A Look At His Unique Ferrari 458 Spider That's Drop-Dead Beautiful</h2><p>If you haven’t noticed yet, Floyd Mayweather has a thing for luxury and super-rare vehicles ranging between $1-3 million. From Porsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet to Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4 and Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano, Floyd just made a habit of purchasing the most expensive supercars ever manufactured. Best known for his flashy lifestyle, the world’s top boxer also owns a Ferrari 458 Spider. We’ve also noticed a tendency in Floyd’s garage. Well, it's not 100% sure, of course, but it seems like The Moneymaker is quite fond of vehicles painted pearl white – and his unique Ferrari 458 Spider kind of proves the point. Floyd’s 2014 Ferrari 458 Spider still retails at $260,000 which is probably nothing for the world’s top boxing champ. After all, his garage is filled to the brim with luxury cars, so the chances are that most of them are already covered in dust. After all, nobody can drive three Veyrons, a couple of Ferraris and Rolls Royces at the same time, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=floyd-said-goodbye-to-his-red-ferrari-enzo-what>Floyd Said Goodbye To His Red Ferrari Enzo! What?!</h2><p>Until recently, the champ has been a proud owner of a Ferrari that’s allegedly worth around $3.2 million. Rumor has it that Floyd Mayweather has decided to get rid of his brutal Ferrari – which, in fact, is still one of the most sought-after supercars. With only 400 made, Ferrari Enzo is definitely an F1-inspired vehicle powered by a mind-blowing 651 hp V12. This vehicle is practically loaded with racing-inspired technology and an exclusive design that never fails to impress. Another crazy feature about Floyd Mayweather’s glossy vehicle is its price. Although such unusual supercars are worth around $3 million, Floyd decided to sell his for at least $3,8 million. Why would anyone want to get rid of such a gorgeous vehicle, right? Well, Floyd's got lots of them so we're pretty sure that he won't miss it that much.</p><h2 id=the-moneymaker-s-garage-lacked-one-specific-vehicle---a-lamborghini-aventador>The MoneyMaker's Garage Lacked One Specific Vehicle - A Lamborghini Aventador</h2><p>When the exclusive Lamborghini Aventador came out in 2011, it was obvious that it’d be a “must-have” for all car enthusiasts out there. If you’re into flashy, high-performance Italian exotics, look no further than the insane Aventador. As an owner of luxury vehicles, Floyd Mayweather didn’t let his chance slip through his fingers. He was one of the first to own a Murcielago, so it really makes sense that he decided to have an Aventador too. The Moneymaker’s ostentatious vehicle boasts the insane 6.5L V12 that turns out a mind-blowing 691 hp to the AWD system. With an impressive 0-60 time of 2.9 seconds and a top speed of over 350 km/h, you can only expect to be thrown back into your seat. But don’t think that Lamborghini is a vehicle for the average car enthusiast. All of its deluxe features can be yours for the “humble” amount of $400,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=floyd-s-garage-houses-the-insane-ferrari-599-gtb-fiorano-worth-350-000>Floyd's Garage Houses The Insane Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano&nbsp;Worth $350,000</h2><p>Was Floyd’s Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano a spur-of-the-moment purchase as well? Maybe it was and his most preferred auto dealers can totally confirm it. Produced by the Italian auto giant, Floyd’s gorgeous Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano boasts over 600bhp which practically gives many other car brands a run for their money. As you can see, Floyd is the type of guy who’s as if in a never-ending rivalry with other celebs. He just does his best to make sure he has the most luxury vehicle the world has ever seen. Maybe this was how the original idea of getting the upscale Ferrari was brought to life. According to both of his auto dealers, Floyd can buy a car at any given moment, even if that means waking them up at 2 am.</p><h2 id=two-bentley-mulsannes-just-for-good-measure>Two Bentley Mulsannes Just For Good Measure</h2><p>Bentley has always been associated with extreme quality, flamboyance, and affluence. And for those, who can actually afford the luxury of Bentley, it really must be a dream come true. Whatever model comes out, Bentley’s price has always been extremely high. Well, this is hardly an issue for guys, like Floyd Mayweather. While most of us would totally faint at the price tag of vehicles, like Bentley, Aventador or Rolls Royce, it’s probably nothing for celebs like him. Not only is his Bentley Mulsanne among the most expensive vehicles in every auto catalog, but it’s a rolling monument to the ultimate luxury as well. This brutal car is powered by a 505-horsepower V8 that goes with 752 pound-feet of torque. Well, Floyd’s fancy Bentleys are extremely heavy which totally justifies the need of that much power.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=floyd-bought-a-gorgeous-mercedes-benz-for-his-son-too>Floyd Bought A Gorgeous Mercedes-Benz For His Son Too</h2><p>Once again, the boxing champ lived up to his 'Money' moniker. He absolutely made it clear that he hardly cares about silly things like the price tag of his jewelry or luxury vehicles. This time, however, he splashed out a six-figure sum on a brand new Mercedes-Benz C-Class for Zion’s 16th birthday. Does that make him the father of the year? All joking aside, Mayweather has definitely made it a day to remember for his son as he made sure to capture the moment with a string of Instagram snaps. Special vehicles, like the elegant C-Class, are a typical sight in Floyd's exceptionally full garage. However, we’re pretty sure that his son will not follow in his father's footsteps and sell the car after a short period of having it.</p><h2 id=a-brand-new-4-8-million-silver-koenigsegg-ccxr-trevita>A Brand-New $4.8 Million Silver Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita</h2><p>Maybe Floyd really got tired of his Ferrari Enzo because he sold it for $3.8M. Rumor has it that Floyd Mayweather got rid of his Ferrari in order to purchase the monstrous Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita. It’s quite hard to believe that he actually wanted to sell the car given how huge his luxury car collection has become. Besides, there aren’t that many owners of the fabulous Enzo anyway. The mind-blowing price of its worthy replacement is justified by the existence of a special carbon-fiber weave with a diamond finish. It turns out that Floyd’s CCXR Trevita is literally made of priceless materials, such as diamonds and unique carbon fiber. Last but not least, Koenigsegg Trevita boasts a 4.8L twin-turbocharged engine. Well, this truly makes it a worthy member of Floyd’s luxury fleet of supercars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">www.businessinsider.com</a>; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">www.dailymail.co.uk</a>; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">www.thesun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoaGXnXqttcWeZqaZqayyosDHnqmsZZKqtKLA06Jkq6ecocBuvs6ymp6rXZa7pXnOrZ%2Beql2owrGx0ZyYq6tdm7%2BwuYytn55lo5a6pnnDnpilnaJirq%2BwjKmYopxdnrtur8Csn2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./12-acting-jobs-you-had-no-idea-these-wrestlers-did.html><span>←</span><span>12 Acting Jobs You Had No Idea These Wrestlers Took On</span></a>
