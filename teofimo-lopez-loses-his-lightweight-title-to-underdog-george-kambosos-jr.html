Professionals can check the stats and make as many predictions based on a boxer's fighting history as they would like, but no one can ever be certain who the better man will be in the ring. This was precisely the case in the long-awaited fight that took place on Saturday, November 27 at Madison Square Garden between Teofimo Lopez and George Kambosos Jr. With all the hype leading up to this fight and the unpopular outcome, it can easily go down as one of the <a href=#>biggest upsets in the history </a>of the lightweight class of boxing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Teofimo Lopez, one of the four lightweight kings among Devin Haney, Gervonta "Tank" Davis, and Vasiliy Lomachenko, is known for his swift movements, dominating power, and on-stage antics. The Brooklyn native had a previous record of 17 fights, 16 wins, 12 knockouts with no losses, and held all the belts of the undisputed unified lightweight division. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that all changed when he went up against the Australian underdog,</a> George 'Ferocious' Kambosos Jr. came in with a record of 18 wins, 10 by knockout, and no losses or draws. But<a href=#> despite his undisputed record</a>, he was overlooked by Teofimo and The Takeover team as an easy payday. And Teofimo, whose previous fight was against the previous lightweight, featherweight, and super featherweight king, Vasily Lomachenko in 2020, didn't expect an outcome of defeat one year later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Greatest Boxing Matches Of All Time</a></span></p><p>Ultimately, Toefimo lost his unified lightweight world titles to George Kambosos who dropped him in the first round of the fight. The Madison Square Garden crowd of New York first began cheering for Teofimo, who was fighting in his hometown. But the surprise attack from Kambosos put a damper on their expectations. What added to the anticipation of this fight was that it was scheduled for earlier in June, but was postponed due to Teofimo contracting Covid, similar to what happened with <a href=#>Oscar De La Hoya</a> in September against Vitor Belfort.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With a flurry of massive knockout punches and brutal combinations shared by both fighters, it became clear that Kambosos was keeping more active with a jab, while Teofimo appeared to be hunting for a single knockout opportunity. The scorecards eventually turned in favor of Kambosos, who won by unanimous decision, shocking the crowd and the world of boxing while also taking home all the title belts.</p><p>But win or lose, both fighters were paid sumptuously for their efforts. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to ESPN,</a> Triller and Matchroom's deposit would result in Teofimo going home with $2.27 million, while the underdog Kambosos would leave with a purse of $1.22 million. It's fair to say that in the world of boxing, anything can happen!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Top 10 Highest-Grossing Pay-Per-View Boxing Matches</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sporting News,</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mirror</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBprvFoqSoZZykvabGjKWmrJ2jYrWqv4yloKCgpKyyqrPHrWStoaShsm7Azmasp5yVp7Gws4ygnKiql5p6rK3Mm6asp6Nit7N7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./july-4th-fabolous-la-marina-nyc-227563.html><span>←</span><span>Spend July 4th With Fabolous At La Marina, NYC</span></a>
