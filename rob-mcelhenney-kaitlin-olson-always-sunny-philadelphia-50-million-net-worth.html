After two years of dating, the couple decided to make it official, tying the knot in 2008. McElhenney and Olson's wedding ceremony took place at the eye-catching Saddlerock Ranch in Malibu. The nature-themed event was held under a large sycamore tree in the middle of the ranch. Though nothing is written about what the lavish yet rustic event cost the couple, the ceremony was nonetheless not free. Most celebrity weddings cost a pretty penny; however, for this wedding, in particular, fans will have to speculate.</p><h2 id=rob-mcelhenney-and-kaitlin-olson-39-s-sherman-oaks-english-traditional-style-home><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Rob McElhenney And Kaitlin Olson's Sherman Oaks English Traditional-Style Home</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in 2008, the same year the couple were married,<strong> McElhenney</strong> and <strong>Olson</strong> purchased a gated home within the San Fernando Valley neighborhood.

What is it about these two and a fine watering hole? In a perfect example of life imitating fiction, the Always Sunny couple decided to purchase a bar back in 2009. Enter:<strong> Mac’s Tavern</strong>. Located at 226 Market Street in Old City, Philadelphia, PA (no surprise there), the former Skinner’s Bar now brings to life a small piece of Always Sunny in Philly. Though the McElhenney’s are not the exclusive owners of the establishment, they are definitely the most famous. The bar was also featured in Phillyvoice.com in 2017 after calling out a couple who dared to dine-and-dash in Mac’s with a Facebook post. It’s like watching a real life episode of the famous sitcom.</p><h2 id=rob-mcelhenney-and-kaitlin-olson-express-themselves-philanthropically><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Rob McElhenney And Kaitlin Olson Express Themselves Philanthropically</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What good is money if you can’t use it to help those of lesser fortune?

Hope you’re all enjoying your time at home. May we respectfully request that you donate to <strong>@philabundance</strong>? They’re doing great work for our most at-risk. We’re gonna match all donations up to<strong> 25k</strong>. Make us spend this Sunny money, damnit. Link to the GoFundMe page in bio,” with Kaitlin adding, “If you guys collectively make it to $50K raised for @philabundance by the end of today, @robmcelhenney and I will donate $35,000. Link in bio! This organization is doing amazing work to help feed people in need in a city that means so much to us. We know times are tough and people are scared.
