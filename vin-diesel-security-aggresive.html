Now, more than ever, celebrities are focused on ensuring their safety when out and about amid the general public. It comes as no surprise when<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the rich and famous </a>are seen surrounded by their protective guards. In fact, it's the norm, and for very good reason. Celebrities dish out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an astounding amount of money</a> on security, and the price tag for round the clock details is a significant one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ </a>is reporting that Vin Diesel is currently enjoying a family vacation to the Dominican Republic, and understandably, he took his security guards along with him, to ensure everyone's safety. In a strange twist, that very security is said to be a safety concern to the neighborhood they are renting, with many reports coming in to state his agents are being "aggressive" and are over taking the lives of the local citizens.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Staggering Amount Of Money Celebrities Spend On Much-Needed Security</a></span></p><p>Employing security comes at a very high cost for celebrities. Their fees don't come cheap, but the need for protection seems to have increased dramatically.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There have been a series of frightening incidents lately involving intruders that make their way into the homes of the rich and famous, and very recently, Kendall Jenner had to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">contend with a stalker</a> that declared he was intending to harm her. Of course, nobody can forget the horrifying incident that happened when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Gaga's dogs were stolen</a>, and her dog walker was left requiring emergency surgery.</p><p>Fans aren't questioning Vin Diesel's choice to bring protection services along with him to his vacation spot, but they are definitely questioning the number of agents he enlisted, and the approach they're taking to the execution of their jobs.</p><p>Reports indicate that Diesel enlisted 12 guards to protect his family in the Dominican Republic, which seems like a drastic move.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They seem to be given instructions that span beyond the ordinary duties a typical security agent would be expected to execute. Neighbors in the community that Diesel and his family are staying in have reported that his security team has blocked the roadways and stood in the way of local commuters, all so that Vin and his children could go for a bicycle ride.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ'</a>s report reveals a first-hand encounter from one of the locals. He states; ""For a few weeks I have personally witnessed and heard from fellow homeowners the unprecedented and abusive display of your security people around our homes and beach. Interrogating us, blocking our street with five or six SUV's. Stopping residents while walking when you ride your bicycle."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The angry neighbor lashed out at this intrusion on his life, and indicated this level of security is definitely overkill. He was quoted as saying; "In over ten years the homeowners in Fundadores Juanillo Beach have never endured and suffered such absurd comportment by anyone renting a home in our very small, private and very secure community."</p><p>Vin Diesel's team responded to say they did not intend to inconvenience anyone.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Ridiculously Expensive Things That Vin Diesel Has Bought</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTDqrqMnaCeq5WherSxwq6poqypYq6os9GeqqKulWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ultimate-thanksgiving-mashup-video-goes-viral-watch-w158457.html><span>←</span><span>Ultimate Thanksgiving Mash-Up Video Goes Viral: Watch</span></a>
