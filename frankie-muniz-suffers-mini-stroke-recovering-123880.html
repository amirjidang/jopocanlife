Today, Muniz, 26, tweeted: “I was in the hospital last Friday. I suffered a ‘<a href=# id=auto-tag_mini_3 data-tag=mini>Mini</a> <a href=# id=auto-tag_stroke_3 data-tag=stroke>Stroke</a>,’ which was not fun at all. Have to start taking care of my body! Getting old!” It’s still unclear what caused his mini stroke according to reports Muniz is recovering at home. Since Malcolm in the Middle came to an end in 2006, Muniz has dedicated his time as the drummer of pop rock band Kingsfoil. Muniz celebrates his 27th birthday tomorrow, December 5th. <a href=# rel=nofollow>People</a> Reports: Muniz provided no more details. But a “mini-stroke” is commonly used to describe a transient ischemic attack, or TIA, when blood temporarily stops reaching the brain, causing stroke-like symptoms for one to 24 hours. Doctors believe a TIA can be a warning sign for a possible full stroke in the future without preventative measures.</p><p>I was in the hospital last Friday.
