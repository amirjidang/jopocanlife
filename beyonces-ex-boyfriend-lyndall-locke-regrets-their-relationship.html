He said "From the first time I saw BeyonceÌ I couldn’t take my eyes off of her. She looked like an angel, the most beautiful girl I’d ever seen.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lyndall-locke-labeled-beyonce-igrave-129-as-shy-during-their-younger-days>Lyndall Locke Labeled BeyonceÌ As 'Shy' During Their Younger Days</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/instar41867233.jpg><p>As soon as the pair met, they went on to spend every waking hours to talk on the phone and get to know each other. Locke recalled, “As we were so young at the time it was very innocent between us. We’d hang out after school and almost every night we’d fall asleep talking to each other on the phone.”</p><p>At the time, Locke said that he had no idea that BeyonceÌ could even sing. He described the singer as a timid and shy young girl. He said, “She was just so shy, she was a bit of an outcast at school and didn’t even sing in the choir. For two years I didn’t know she could sing."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Did Beyonce Get Caught Losing It On Jay-Z Over His Phone Usage?">Did Beyonce Get Caught Losing It On Jay-Z Over His Phone Usage?</a></span></p><p>The pair bonded by watching movies together and playing Connect 4. Sometimes they'd hang out with <a href=#>Beyonce's younger sister Solange</a> and Kelly as well.</p><p>Locke further recalled, “Some of our most fun times was when I watched BeyonceÌ, her sister Solange and Kelly performing dance routines. So while I had no idea how good her voice was back then, I certainly knew she could move.”</p><p>As their relationship progressed, BeyonceÌ found the courage to go to auditions. She would go to a monthly audition trip to Atlanta with her best friend Kelly Rowland to sing in front of record executives. When Locke noticed the frequent trips to Atlanta, BeyonceÌ confided her dreams of making it big in the music industry.</p><p>He said, “I won’t lie, I was surprised, but that’s just BeyonceÌ, she is the last person on earth to ever dream of bragging about herself.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beyonce-igrave-129-s-fame-soon-strained-her-relationship-with-lyndall-locke>BeyonceÌ's Fame Soon Strained Her Relationship With Lyndall Locke<img alt="Destiny's Child at the 2005 FASHION ROCKS" height=1574 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/instar41866961.jpg width=2250 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h2><p>Despite the frequent trips to Atlanta, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their relationship prospered smoothly</a>. BeyonceÌ and Locke grew closer and closer and Locke even remembers the memory of their first kiss.</p><p>"It was just after BeyonceÌ’s 15th birthday. I surprised her with Brian McKnight concert tickets, and it happened that night. I had got popcorn and as we were sitting in our seats I dropped it. As we both went down to grab it we bumped heads, and locked into our first kiss."</p><p>“We both just looked at each other realizing there was this incredible spark of fireworks between us. It was that fairytale kiss you only hear about in the movies. That was the first feeling of true love between me and BeyonceÌ. Still, to this day, I’ve never had another kiss as passionate as that one.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Did BeyoncÃ© Reference The Solange Elevator Drama On Her New Album?">Did Beyoncé Reference The Solange Elevator Drama On Her New Album?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As <a href=#>their young love thrived</a>, BeyonceÌ's career started to flourish. BeyonceÌ's singing career soon took off as part of the girl group Destiny's Child which initially consisted of BeyonceÌ, Kelly Rowland, LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett. As soon as BeyonceÌ achieved some level of fame, it started to strain the relationship.</p><p>Locke revealed, “It was honestly a dream come true. But immediately after their first single she became a workaholic, focusing all of her energy on her career. But we still always found time for each other, and I was never in any doubt about how much BeyonceÌ loved me — she would tell me all the time.”</p><h2 id=lyndall-locke-locke-ultimately-regrets-letting-go-of-his-relationship-with-beyonce-igrave-129>Lyndall Locke Locke Ultimately Regrets Letting Go Of His Relationship With BeyonceÌ</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BeyonceÌ's ex-boyfriend opened up</a> about his regrets on losing the singer.</p><p>He said, “Beyonce was the love of my life and I was hers, so losing her is still my biggest regret.

He revealed that he was unfaithful with <a href=#>the former Destiny's Child member</a>.</p><p>"I’ll be honest — it was me that messed everything up and lost her forever to Jay-Z, but I deserved it.
