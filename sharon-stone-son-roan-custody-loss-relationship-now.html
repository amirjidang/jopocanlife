She became famous for her memorable role in Basic Instinct. And in the decades since, she has starred in horror movies like Deadly Blessing and TV shows like The Flight Attendant. Even though she's an incredibly talented actress, Stone's 2008 custody battle with her ex-husband Phil Bronstein over her son Roan has gotten even more attention than her movie and TV parts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans got a front-row seat to the custody trouble and learned that <a href=#>Sharon Stone wanted to Botox Roan's feet</a>. Sharon Stone has two other children, 16-year-old Quinn Kelly and 17-year-old Laird Vonne Stone. Now that Roan Stone is 22 years old, does Sharon Stone get along with him?</p><h2 id=what-is-sharon-stone-39-s-relationship-with-her-son-roan-today>What Is Sharon Stone's Relationship With Her Son Roan Today?</h2><p><a href=#>Sharon Stone lost custody of Roan</a> and the actress says that her part in Basic Instinct was a big reason why. She said that the judge asked Roan if he was aware of her career, which included intimate scenes in movies like Basic Instinct. This is hard to hear about and definitely seems very unfair.</p><p>According to The Daily Mail, Phil Bronstein and Sharon Stone adopted Roan in 2000. They fought for who would be awarded full custody of Roan in 2008 after getting divorced in 2004. Stone was still allowed to see her son, but of course, that could never compare to being with him all the time. Stone was honest about how terrible this experience was and how all she wanted was to have custody again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sharon-roan-stone-1.jpg><p>It seems that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sharon and Roan Stone have an amazing relationship</a> today. According to Page Six, they have "a close bond." And in 2019, Roan wanted to go by the last name Stone again. That definitely signals that the custody loss didn't change things between them. He explained that he would be called Roan Bronstein Stone and that way, he could ensure that he used his mom's and his dad's last name.</p><p>Roan was very young when the custody battle was going on. It's possible that he doesn't remember much about it or chooses not to think about it since it must have been very traumatic for him and his mom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Sharon Stone Revealed She Wasn't Comfortable Around Michael Douglas During Basic Instinct</a></span></p><p>In July 2021, Page Six reported that the mother and son were going shopping in Beverly Hills. The publication said that they were "laughing." It sounds like they get along well today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/roan-stone-white-outfit-1.jpg><p>Sharon Stone often mentions her son Roan on her Instagram account. In July 2022, she posted several photos of her son and simply wrote in the caption, "Roan Stone." At the end of 2020, she posted that her sons Roan and Laird had gone on a road trip and that they slept in the car.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-has-sharon-stone-said-about-motherhood-and-her-son-roan>What Has Sharon Stone Said About Motherhood And Her Son Roan?</h2><p>Being a mother is important to Sharon Stone, who has a highlight on her Instagram called "Family" and who posts about her children a lot. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stone talked about her children</a> in a 2018 interview with People and talked about how being with her three sons made her happy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sharon-stone-lenscrafters.png><p>Stone said to People, “I live in the same house I’ve had for 25 years, and I feel happy waking up in my house with my kids. They’re at a wonderful age when we don’t have to have a nanny living with us anymore. I can wake up on a Saturday and I come downstairs, and they’re playing and we hang out. We swim, play basketball, we watch movies. We have such a lovely family dynamic.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on her comments, it doesn't sound like losing custody of Roan affected Stone's relationship with him or her two other children. They must be happy and relieved to put all of that in the past.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Given Her Low $500,000 Salary In Basic Instinct, Sharon Stone Had A Clause In Her Contract To Keep The Clothes From The Film</a></span></p><p>It seems like life is much more peaceful for Sharon Stone and her family than it once was. According to The Daily Mail, the custody fight went on for 13 years. The Sun reported that Stone adopted Laird in 2005 and Quinn in 2006. She was honest about having miscarriages and fertility problems.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/roan-stone-sharon-stone-son.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Entertainment Tonight, Sharon Stone shared about losing Roan in "The Beauty Of Living Twice," her memoir. Stone wrote, "I fought for my son, put him ahead of getting anything at all back in my life. I did that for 13 years; I played a very long, very difficult game of custody chess in an effort to get him everything I could for his health and well-being. Now my home and my family are complete and I am able to re-find success in the rest of my life, as my heart is also complete."</p><h2 id=what-does-roan-stone-do-for-a-living>What Does Roan Stone Do For A Living?</h2><p>While there is of course a lot of press about Sharon Stone, her acting career, and her custody loss of her son Roan, there aren't a lot of details out there about Roan himself.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Sharon Stone's Former Nanny Was Fired After She Refused To Give Back Her Overtime Funds</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it doesn't appear that Roan is an actor like his mom, he has done some modeling. He was the spring 2020 cover star of Odda magazine. According to the magazine's Instagram post about the issue, Roan said during his interview, "Empathy and caring for one another: these characteristics are so important. Without them, we lose our humanity."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/roan-stone.jpg><p>Odda Magazine called Roan a "traveler," so it seems that is one of his biggest interests. In her 2018 interview with People, Sharon Stone talked about Roan being an amazing artist. She said Roan is a "gifted glassblower." The actress also said that at the time, Roan was in “a beautiful period of his development where he’s really finding himself.” Since Roan is only in his early 20s, it sounds like he is figuring things out, which is relatable. And it's really sweet that his mother supports him and seems to be there for him along the way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While fans would love to know more about Roan, perhaps he wants to be private. This would definitely make sense considering the public custody battle that his parents went through.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqoZmipLtuv9OopZ5lo6S7br7OmqVmm6WowbCw2GajqKujYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXnNqK5o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-john-stewart-take-a-fiveyear-break-because-of-trevor-noah.html><span>←</span><span>Did John Stewart Take A Five-Year Break Because Of Trevor Noah?</span></a>
