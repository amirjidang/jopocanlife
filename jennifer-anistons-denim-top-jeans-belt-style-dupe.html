Also the queen of hair, acting, agelessness, kindness and overall style, but you knew that already. Our point is, any time Aniston throws on some denim, we’re instantly captivated. While previously we couldn’t get enough of her love for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">rag & bone</a>, our most recent mission was to recreate her look from one of her most famous photo shoots to date — for less, of course!</p><p>Aniston did a shoot for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a> last fall to promote “The Morning Show,” wearing a button-up denim top, matching wide leg jeans and a statement belt. To say we loved the look would be a massive understatement. Canadian tuxedos are officially in. Loving the look from afar wasn’t enough for Us though, which is why we found super similar pieces, all on Amazon, that will help perfect our recreation — and yours too! We can all join in on the fun. Check out our finds below!</p><p><strong>Top</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/levis-denim-shirt.jpg><p>This is the updated version of the top Aniston wore in her shoot, so if you’re going for authenticity, you have it!
