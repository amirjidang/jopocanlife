Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. I’ve been prepared for this for a number of years."</p><p>James, whose cancer spread to his spine, brain and lungs at the start of the decade, takes a multitude of drugs to keep himself alive every day.</p><p>He said, "They’re still treating some of the issues. I have a brain tumour on my pituitary gland, which affects your hormones but can still be treated in several ways.</p><p>"Basically, I have to choose between the quality and quantity of life and I’ve chosen quality so that I can have a good time and make great memories with my lovely wife, Nadine.</p><p>"At some point, we always die. It could be any time really for me, but luckily at the moment I can still work here at TalkTV and Radio."</p><p><a href=#>One of the country's most revered radio personalities</a>,&nbsp;James has been in the business for no less than 50 years and recently received the first ever&nbsp;<a href=#>TRIC Recognition Award</a>&nbsp;for his outstanding work.</p><p>He's helped countless others too, having launched the&nbsp;James Whale Fund for Kidney Cancer in 2006 - now known as Kidney Cancer UK - the nation's leading specialist charity of its kind.</p><p>James reflected, "I’ve had a good life, I can’t complain. But I’m just gonna make the next months as entertaining and interesting as I can, which is all any of us can do.</p><p>"Whatever age you may be, if you were told you only had another year or a couple of months to live, rather than sitting at home feeling sorry for yourself, I think you'd be out there having a great time."</p><p>The Surrey-native, who often credits Nadine for her support, concluded, "Please bear in mind also, it must be much more difficult to be the partner of somebody who is going through this.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"So as the saying goes, onwards and upwards.
