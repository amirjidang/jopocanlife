She dated <strong>Kenny Braasch</strong>, <strong>James Bonsall</strong> and <strong>Blake Monar</strong> during the ABC series, but she ultimately left the beach single. When she got home to Nashville, however, Mock was was ready to give romance a shot.</p><p>“He got the balls one day to try to hit on me and <a href=#>get me to hang out with him</a>, and I was like, ‘Sweetie, I’m going on Bachelor in Paradise. I’ll see you later,’” Booth recalled during an October 2021 episode of the “Click Bait” podcast. “Then after I got home, I was like, ‘Damn, this freaking dude has been right here trying this whole time, which is all I asked for on the show.’ So, then I gave it a shot and we’ve been good.”</p><p>The Arkansas native, who made her <a href=#>Bachelor Nation</a> debut during <a href=#><strong>Arie Luyendyk Jr.</strong></a>‘s season of The Bachelor, got engaged to Mock in April 2022. The Arizona State University alum proposed during the Atlanta tour stop of Bachelor Live On Stage.</p><p>When Mock got down on one knee to pop the question, a shocked Booth asked, “Are you kidding me?” Host <a href=#><strong>Becca Kufrin</strong></a> and her now-fiancé <a href=#><strong>Thomas Jacobs</strong></a> knew in advance that the big moment was coming and managed to keep it a secret from their fellow Bachelor Nation member.</p><p>“My mom knew, of course. Taylor and her <a href=#>had been talking about it</a> for a few a weeks,” Booth noted after the proposal. “She is stone cold. I didn’t catch on from her at all. Taylor asked for my mom’s blessing. He didn’t get a chance to ask my dad for his blessing before he passed, but he asked my mom and I know my dad would have said yes. He would have given him a hard time, but he would have said yes.”</p><p>In June 2022, the duo revealed that <a href=#>they’re expecting their first child</a>. Booth announced the news via Instagram in a Father’s Day post that also paid tribute to her late dad, who died earlier in the year following a battle with colon cancer.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“This has undoubtedly been my most challenging season thus far,” she wrote. “While I wish I could tell my dad all the good news in person, it brings me peace that he knows about it long before I do. Welcoming a new little life while mourning the loss of another proves that high emotions can exist simultaneously, and I have no doubt my dad had a hand in this. Happy heavenly Father’s Day to the first man I ever loved and Happy soon-to-be Father’s Day to my forever.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for five things to know about Mock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwaqtjJumqKyYqHqntcCnmp5lpJbGrbvRZqSom5tigm7Ax6KloKtdqbxut82ormg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./temptations-singer-dies-age-74.html><span>←</span><span>The Temptations Singer Dies At Age 74</span></a>
