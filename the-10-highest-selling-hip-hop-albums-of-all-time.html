Its elements include emceeing, deejaying, breaking graft, and beatboxing. The ‘holy trinity’ of early hip-hop is a term used to recognize the three founders of this movement. The pioneering <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hip-hop DJs</a>&nbsp; included Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash, and Afrika Bambaataa.</p><p>It became popular in the 1980s and 1990s as background music for rap, the musical style that incorporates rhythmic and rhyming speech and became the movement's most durable and important art form. From its infancy to the modern day, the 21st century has seen remarkable evolution of the Hip Hop industry.</p><p>There are over fifty albums that have been recognized as multi-platinum or diamond, but only a handful of them depict some of the major turning points in hip-hop. From the rise of rap superstars to the establishment of this genre's cultural significance, we can see the effect an artist has on the market through their record sales.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here are the ten highest-selling hip-hop albums of all time.</p><h2 id=nelly-country-grammar-2000>Nelly, Country Grammar (2000)</h2><p>Nelly's debut studio album, Country Grammar, was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2016. The record was initially released on June 27, 2000, and it remained at number one on the US Billboard Chart for a total of five straight weeks.</p><p>The album features Nelly's signature rapping style, which pulls heavily on his Southern upbringing by blending standard American English with a twang typical of his home state of Missouri. Nelly incorporates his singing and rapping on every tracks, making Country Grammar a pop-rap album.</p><p>Since its release, the album has sold ten million copies.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Certified Bestseller: These Are Drake's Highest-Grossing Albums</a></span></p><h2 id=lauryn-hill-the-miseducation-of-lauryn-hill-1998>Lauryn Hill, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One may say that The Miseducation of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauryn Hill </a>marked a watershed point for hip-hop and popular music in general. Hill broke the record for best first-week album sales by a female artist in the 20th century. The album entered the US Billboard 200 at the top spot. The lead track was also a Billboard Hot 100 top 10 entry. An unprecedented position on the charts for a female rapper.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">At the 41st Annual Grammy Awards</a>, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was recognized with ten nominations for several categories.

The album's achievement at the top of the charts can be attributed in large part to the smash hit single "U Can't Touch This." Many films and TV shows have used this song in their soundtracks.</p><p>MC Hammer received criticism for including samples of other musicians' tracks on his album. A case for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">infringement of copyright</a> on "U Can't Touch This" by Rick James was settled out of court when MC Hammer acknowledged James as a co-composer. Samples on the album include songs from Prince, James Brown, Faith No More, and Barry White.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Please Hammer Don’t Hurt ‘Em was the best-selling album of 1990 in the US and has 17 million copies globally.</p><h2 id=beastie-boys-licensed-to-ill-1986>Beastie Boys, Licensed to Ill (1986)</h2><p>In the United States, the rap group Beastie Boys first appeared in 1981.
