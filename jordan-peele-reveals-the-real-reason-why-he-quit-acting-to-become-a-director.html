I can watch the films I direct [but] watching me perform just feels like...a bad kind of masturbatory. It's masturbation you don't enjoy. I feel like I got to do so much and it is a great feeling,” Peele told </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Hollywood Reporter</span></i></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About How Jordan Peele Came Up With 'Get Out"</a></span></p><p>“When I think about those great moments when you're basking in something you said that feels funny. When I think about all that, I think I got enough," he added.</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Before Peele made his directorial debut, he started his career as an actor, appearing in </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>MadTV</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> sketches, then later the comedy show </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style=font-weight:400>Key & Peele</span></i></a><span style=font-weight:400> on Comedy Central, which he created with longime friend Keegan Michael Key. The show was often praised for being a modern version of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Chappelle's Show</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Even though Peele enjoys acting, he’s always had the desire to tell stories through movies. After his first feature film,&nbsp;</span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Get Out,</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> was praised for its artistic direction, Peele continued to act in a series of voiceover roles.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sinkhole: Jordan Peele's New Mystery Film Is Deeper Than You Think</a></span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In 2018, he recounted the offer he received for a role in </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Emoji Movie</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. Peele explained why that offer </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=font-weight:400>motivated him to retire from acting</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“I was offered the role of Poop. This is true. I would not make this up," he said. "He called his manager the following day to ask how much he was being offered for the role, but [My manager] said, 'They've already given it to Sir Patrick Stewart.' I was like, 'F*ck this.’”</span></p><p>Since <i>The Emoji Movie</i>, Peele has not abandoned his acting roots entirely. He has appeared in <i>Big Mouth</i>, <i>The Twilight Zone</i>, and <i>Toy Story 4</i>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, Peele’s directing style is so unique that anyone can tell that he has an undeniable love for film-making. Peele went on to explain that being a director has given him greater satisfaction than acting ever could.</p><p>"I knew I was making a movie for us. I knew I was making a movie for the me that didn't feel represented in the [horror] genre and for everybody,” he said.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lovecraft Country: Jordan Peele's HBO Horror Series Could Be Shockingly Relevant</a></span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“For all the Black people who are screaming at the screen, 'Have some sense, get the f*ck out of the house, get some Black people in here so somebody can do the right thing,'” he continued. “When that hit home and I felt that, it was just extreme warmth. Everything else after that was just gravy."</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Peele is currently working on another horror film, which will hit theaters in 2022, as well as a remake of Wes Craven’s T</span><i><span style=font-weight:400>he People Under The Stairs</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.
