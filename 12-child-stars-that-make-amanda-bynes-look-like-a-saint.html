Even though she is among the most recent celebs to suffer a breakdown, there are several other stars who&nbsp;prove&nbsp;Bynes is not the only child actor&nbsp;to be affected by fame at a young age.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many other stars have been damaged from the Hollywood spotlight. When they hit a rough patch, these celebs&nbsp;hit the ground hard<i>. </i>With the pressure of&nbsp;fame&nbsp;and&nbsp;the mysticism of what money can buy, these stars may be given&nbsp;too much at a young age. From drug addictions and robbery to social isolation and violence, these fellow celebrities show that Amanda Bynes may not be perfect, but she is far from the only star that has been in trouble with the law. Take a look at other child stars that make Bynes look like a saint.</p><h2 id=12-jodie-sweetin><b>12. Jodie Sweetin</b></h2><p>Known for her role as Stephanie, the adorable&nbsp;middle child on the '90s hit show&nbsp;<i>Full House</i>, <a title="Jodie Sweetin Net Worth" href=#>Jodie Sweetin</a>&nbsp;was one of Hollywood's sweethearts. Unfortunately, the young star did not cope well with the show coming to an end. After eight years on the show, then 13-year-old Sweetin found herself leading a very different lifestyle than that of a successful young actress. In the wake of <i>Full House </i>coming to a close,<i> </i>Sweetin fell into a drug addiction, that included crystal meth and cocaine. According to Us magazine, she has admitted to driving&nbsp;drunk with her daughter in the car and even showed up to a premiere "as high as a kite."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully, Sweetin now claims to be sober, and that it took time and tremendous effort to get to this place. Chronicling her experiences with addiction, Sweetin published a memoir titled <i>UnSweetined: A Memoir. </i>Today, Sweetin continues to act, though nothing has quite lived up to her <i>Full House</i> days.</p><p></p><h2 id=11-dutch-elijah-whitlock><b>11. Dutch Elijah Whitlock</b></h2><p>Disney’s <i>High School Musical </i>was a smash hit. The upbeat 2006 musical featured teens who loved music and preforming. One of the show’s minor characters, Dutch (Elijah) Whitlock was known for his adorable curly hair and skater look. Just two years after <i>High School Musical </i>was released, then 19-year-old Whitlock found himself in trouble with the law when he was arrested and charged with aggravated robbery of a Utah pizza joint. Whitlock’s mug shot is a far cry from his adorable <i>High School Musical </i>look, showing how perception is not always reality. Since the incident, Whitlock’s acting career seems to have slowed considerably. His&nbsp;last acting gig was a small role in the 2007 comedy film <i>Believe.</i></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=10-marcus-t-paulk><b>10. Marcus T. Paulk</b></h2><p><a title="Marcus T. Paulk Net Worth" href=#>Marcus T. Paulk</a> is best known for his role as the character Myles on the late '90s show <i>Moesha</i>. Paulk has continued acting, appearing in some films and television shows over the past fourteen years since <i>Moesha </i>ended. While Paulk generally stayed out of trouble, he began&nbsp;this year on the wrong foot — in January Paulk was arrested and charged with a DUI and drug possession. The 28 year old actor has other acting gigs lined up, including a short revolving around online relationships called <i>#Short</i>. Hopefully Paulk’s year will finish on a more positive note.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-macaulay-culkin><b>9. Macaulay Culkin</b></h2><p>The iconic '90s film star <a title="Macaulay Culkin Net Worth" href=#>Macaulay Culkin</a> was a young actor who seemed to be the ideal kid-next-door. He was funny, relatable and sensitive. Best known for his roles in the films <i>My Girl, Home Alone </i>and <i>Home Alone 2, </i>Macaulay was at the peak of his young fame in the 1990s. Perhaps burnt out on all the fame, he&nbsp;dropped out of the spotlight for many years, choosing to return to the film world in the early 2000s. In 2004, Culkin was arrested for possession of both marijuana and prescription pills. In 2012 he was photographed by the paparazzi looking extremely thin and pale, causing many to worry about the actor's lifestyle. According to the National Inquirer, Culkin was spending $6,000 a month on drugs that included oxycodone and heroin. But his reps have responded to that statement saying 'that is ridiculously fictitious'. Though the images of him will still remain a question to most.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While no other arrests were made, Culkin is surprisingly private and reserved from the celebrity world. He&nbsp;appeared on a couple of television shows in the late 2000s, including <i>Kings </i>and <i>Robot Chicken </i>but still remains reclusive.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-edward-furlong><b>8. Edward Furlong</b></h2><p>Best known for his riveting roles in films like <i>Terminator 2</i>, <i>American History X </i>and <i>Animal Factory, </i>it seemed like Furlong had everything going for him. His roles were diverse and interesting. Unfortunately, the appeal and convenience of drugs got the better of Furlong, who spent many years in the throws of a heroin and cocaine addiction. Furlong’s drug use greatly affected his work. While he&nbsp;did eventually achieve sobriety in the late 2000s, he has spent many months in jail&nbsp;for domestic violence related charges since becoming sober. In 2012 he was fired from a movie role due his arrest at LAX. In 2013 he was arrested for blowing off his restraining order and for an altercation he had with his estranged girlfriend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While still appearing in some acting roles, Furlong’s past addition and violence troubles seem to keep him from regaining the consistent on-screen familiarity of his youth.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-orlando-brown><b>7. Orlando Brown</b></h2><p>Orlando Brown, who was once an actor on the show&nbsp;<i>That’s So Raven,&nbsp;</i>has had his fair share of run-ins with the law. Brown has been charged with a DUI in the past and as recently as 2014, was charged with disturbing the peace and public intoxication following a supposed death threat. According to Daily News, he was arrested after showing up to a woman's apartment threatening to kill her and her child. Since that incident he has been charged with three more crimes, one&nbsp;for a domestic dispute involving a weapon.</p><p>Orlando Brown has also appeared on the television shows <i>Fillmore! </i>and <i>The Proud Family. </i>The 27 year old has been focusing on his work since the incidents, we hope it stays that way.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-paris-hilton><b>6. Paris Hilton</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Heir to the massive family owned Hilton hotel chain, <a title="Paris Hilton Net Worth" href=#>Paris Hilton</a> has always lived in the world of the 1%. Never needing to worry about finances or worrying whether her desires could be pursued, Hilton was able to party and enjoy her young life as much as she liked. Her household name and Hollywood-friendly looks gave Paris a magnetism in the LA club scene. In the early 2000s, it was hard to walk by any magazine rack without seeing a provocative image of Paris leaving&nbsp;a nightclub or someone talking about her leaked 2003 sex tape with then boyfriend Rick Salomon.&nbsp;Once she became&nbsp;a front page favorite, the fame seemed to have gotten to her. The following years included various arrests&nbsp;, one in 2006 for a DUI, twice in 2007 for driving with an invalid licence and in 2010, she was arrested for possession of cocaine in Las Vegas. Most remember her very short stint in prison as well. Her life seemed to be spiralling out of control with the alcohol abuse and her friends seemed&nbsp;to be on the same page.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now this young star seems more reserved, focusing on her life and career, we hope it remains that way.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-jaimee-foxworth><b>5. Jaimee Foxworth</b></h2><p>Jaimee Foxworth was&nbsp;ten years old when she first appeared on the sitcom <i>Family Matters. </i>Foxworth was a part of <i>Family Matters </i>for four years. Much like Sweetin, Foxworth’s life went from a comfortable acting career to a teen dealing with the extreme pressures of adult responsibilities, causing her to develop depression and turn to drugs to cope. In an extreme turn of her career, Foxworth began preforming in X-rated&nbsp;films, which escalated her drug use.</p><p>By the late 2000s, Foxworth reemerged as a more stable and happy young woman. While her acting carer never really took off after <i>Family Matters, </i>it is a relief to see that Foxworth was able to overcome her struggles.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-shia-labeouf><b>4.&nbsp;Shia Labeouf</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a title="Shia LaBeouf Net Worth" href=#>Shia LaBeouf</a>&nbsp;has seen quite a few transformations over his young acting career. From a successful start in acting on the Disney channel to his breakout role in <a title="Michael Bay Net Worth" href=#>Michael Bay</a>’s 2007 <i>Transformers </i>film, Shia has shown he is able and willing to reinvent himself for the screen. Despite his&nbsp;impressive acting career, he does have a legal record. Beginning in the mid 2000s, LaBeouf began having issues with the law, for reasons such as; trespassing, assault with a deadly weapon and drunk driving. LaBeouf has also had accusations of plagiarism and has seen trouble with the law for public brawls as recently as 2014. LaBeouf continues to act regularly and has two films set to release this year.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-danny-bonaduce><b>3. Danny Bonaduce</b></h2><p><a title="Danny Bonaduce Net Worth" href=#>Danny Bonaduce</a> may be older than many of the others on this list, but his beginnings are similar to many of his fellow stars. Bonaduce began his acting career as a child on the hit 70s show <i>The Partridge Family, </i>a role for which he&nbsp;was given much praise. Following the show’s success, the actor&nbsp;went through many hardships, including being homeless and addicted to drugs. Violent altercations and drug arrests also litter Bonaduce’s past. While things seem to have gotten better for him&nbsp;in more recent years, he is another child star who shows the challenges of outliving a troubled past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-lindsay-lohan><b>2. Lindsay Lohan</b></h2><p><a title="Lindsay Lohan Net Worth" href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a> has been acting since she was ten years old. She&nbsp;was only 11 when she starred as Hallie Parker / Annie James in the 1998 revamp of the family friendly film titled <i>The Parent Trap. </i>From that point on, Lohan was a teen sweetheart that seemed to be the envy of all young women. Despite her success with hit films like <i>Freaky Friday </i>and <i>Mean Girls, </i>Lohan seemed to succumb to the pressures of growing up in young Hollywood as her behavior became&nbsp;more problematic. In 2006, Lohan began seeking treatment for alcohol addiction. Since 2006, Lohan has had several arrests for driving under the influence and drug charges, including two brief stints in jail. Despite struggling to meet probation requirements and regularly returning to rehab, Lohan continues to work on her acting career.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-justin-bieber><b>1. Justin Bieber</b></h2><p>When <a title="Justin Bieber Net Worth" href=#>Justin Bieber</a>&nbsp;emerged&nbsp;in the pop music world at only fifteen years old, it seemed that he&nbsp;was going to be a huge star—he could sing, play guitar and had the right blend of charm and reliability to gain him new fans each day. This once down to earth&nbsp;and&nbsp;sweet kid seemed to have a bit too much access and freedom from his newfound success, as his attitude became increasingly more egotistical and unappreciative. In 2014, Bieber was arrested for assault, drag racing and a DUI.&nbsp;Not only has Bieber had his issues with the law but he has also been caught acting out on various occasions,&nbsp;and each time the media was there&nbsp;to headline the story.</p><p>At the&nbsp;recent Comedy Central Roast of Justin Bieber, Justin himself closed the segment stating that he apologizes for his recent behavior and wants to be someone that everyone can be proud of. Here’s to hoping he can grow into a more graceful adult.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>people.com</a>, <a href=#>stylecaster.com</a>, <a href=#>thehothits.com</a>, <a href=#>listverse.com</a>, <a href=#>tmz.com</a>, <a href=#>usmagazine.com</a>, <a href=#>mirror.co.uk</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqal2Ytaq4w2aqrZmiqHq1tMCtZKaZm5p6ornAp5uaZZKuu6a%2FjKWmqKNdobassYyaZKyZmaPBcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-nameplate-necklaces-amazon-personalized-affordable-under-75.html><span>←</span><span>11 Favorite Custom Nameplate Necklaces on Amazon All Under $75</span></a>
