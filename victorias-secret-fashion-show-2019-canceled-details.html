For the first time since 1995, Victoria’s Secret won’t be sending lacy-lingerie-clad models wearing wings down the runway.

He said, “We’ll be communicating to customers, but nothing that I would say is similar in magnitude to the fashion show.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Gigi-Hadid-Victorias-Secret-Fashion-Show-Promo.jpg><p>In May, the brand revealed that the event wouldn’t be airing on television because it no longer felt like the “right fit,” but Victoria’s Secret model, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Shanina Shaik</strong></a>, revealed even more to The Telegraph. “Unfortunately the Victoria’s Secret show won’t be happening this year,” she said. “It’s something I’m not used to because every year around this time I’m training like an Angel.”</p><p>During Thursday’s interview, Burgdoerfer suggested that rebranding is top-priority for the company. “We think it’s important to evolve the marketing of Victoria’s Secret,” he said on the call.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Last year, former chief marketing officer of L Brands, Edward Razek, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a> that transgender women don’t have a place in the show. He said, “Shouldn’t you have transsexuals in the show? No. No, I don’t think we should. Well, why not? Because the show is a fantasy.” Since Ed Razek’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">departure from the company</a> in August the brand has attempted to right its wrongs. In the past few months, Victoria’s Secret has hired <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">transgender model <strong>Victoria Sampaio</strong></a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">plus-sized model <strong>Ali Tate-Cutler</strong></a> for the brand’s collaboration with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluebella lingerie.</a></p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E News!</a> in September, Tate-Cutler opened up about her new gig with the controversial brand. “I feel like they are headed in the right direction and they are listening to their audience who have requested to see more women of diverse shapes and sizes,” she explained. “I think if they continue to head in that direction they will be on to a jackpot because that is reflective of what the average woman in America.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6u2pMDOq6Caq12osqS%2BxK1kn5mjnbawuoysn6ivXWd9coWMnJinm5WhsqV5w56rmqGcqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./travis-scott-headlining-40-love-super-bowl-weekend-1234734635.html><span>←</span><span>Travis Scott Headlining 40 Love Pop-Up During Super Bowl Weekend</span></a>
