Living apart, having crazy stressful schedules, and having every second of your life documented would definitely put some strain on any relationship! While many celeb marriages end amicably with the duo staying friends afterwards, there are at least an equal number of wildly nasty divorces that rock tabloid headlines for weeks. From cheating scandals to abuse to even weirder stuff, the tabloids love to come up with rumors about stars whether or not they are true. In today's technology saturated world, these stories spread like wildfire and soon everyone is believing they are true. It is especially easy to craft a story with so-called evidence anyone can create using cell phone videos and photos. Sometimes that even spreads to the celebrity's significant other! Many times stars address the rumors as being untrue and power through the hard times of their relationship. Other celebrities, though, are super fragile and their marriages just can't weather a huge amount of bad press. It makes me honestly feel bad but at the same time I love reading about the latest celebrity gossip! Keep reading to learn more about 20 celebrity couples who broke up due to the rumor mill!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-and-brad-pitt>Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt</h2><p>If you were alive and aware of celebrity gossip in the early 00s, this was the celebrity split that gutted you. Aniston and Pitt were a true Hollywood power couple. Jennifer was the star of "Friends" and Brad was starting to make a real name for himself in the movie business. The pair got married in 2000 and were together for five years until it all came crashing down. The first rumor that hacked away at their relationship was that the couple couldn't agree on whether or not to have kids. Aniston still doesn't have any children while Pitt has a lot, so there seems to be truth to that one. What finally sealed the deal, though, was the rumor of Pitt's affair with his co-star and future wife Angelina Jolie. Remember those "Team Jolie" and "Team Aniston" t-shirts?!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ben-affleck-and-jennifer-garner>Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner</h2><p>Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner were one of Hollywood's cutest and most wholesome couples for years. Though they were both in committed relationships when they met, the duo got together five years later and had 3 adorable kids together. Everyone thought they would be the Hollywood couple that would make it last. However, everything went wrong in 2015. After Affleck's cringey comment during his Oscar speech about working on their marriage, the gossip magazines started printing stories of the actor and director's affair with nanny Christine Ouzounian. Though Affleck continues to deny these claims, it was the final straw for the couple. The pair split in 2015 but didn't officially file for divorce until 2017. Many wished in those 2 years that the couple would reconcile, but their marriage just couldn't be saved after the allegations against Ben.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kourtney-kardashian-and-scott-disick>Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick</h2><p>Fans of "Keeping Up With The Kardashians" probably feel they know about the ups and downs of this relationship as well as Kourtney and Scott do. The couple started dating in 2006 but didn't appear together on the reality show until 2008. When rumors of Scott's womanizing habits surfaced, the pair split up for the first time. But in 2009, Kourtney announced she was pregnant with their first child Mason and the pair got back together. They stayed together for another rocky year but broke up again due to Scott's addiction problems. This back and forth continued when they got back together in 2011 and gave birth to a second child a year later and a third child in 2014. Though it seemed like the duo could finally stick it out this time, they split for good in 2015 due to Scott's cheating rumors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-cruise-and-katie-holmes>Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes</h2><p>"TomKat" aka Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes was a weird couple from the start. The world grew to find their awkward romance both cute and cringe worthy. Remember when Cruise jumped up and down on Oprah's couch proclaiming his love for Holmes? The pair got married in a crazy expensive Italian wedding in 2006 and welcomed their only daughter Suri that same year. However, six years later the couple suddenly split in one of Hollywood's weirdest divorces of all time. Stories of Holmes using burner phones and hiring multiple lawyers to deal with the split surfaced but the break up happened fast. Gossip surrounding Cruise's strong connections to Scientology constantly swirled around the couple. Many think they even broke up because Holmes wanted to protect Suri from the strange and secretive religion.</p><h2 id=gwen-stefani-and-gavin-rossdale>Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale</h2><p>The story of Gavin Rossdale and Gwen Stefani's romance is a wild one! The rocker duo were married for 13 years, making theirs one of the longest yet most tumultuous love stories in show biz. I honestly wonder how Gwen stayed with Gavin so long considering the insane amount of cheating rumors surrounding him. The craziest one is that he has a love child with British designer Pearl Lowe, which actually turned out to be true. Rocker Courtney Love claims to have had an affair with Rossdale while he was in a relationship with Stefani. Rossdale also admitted to a gay affair with cross-dressing singer Marilyn. With so many cheating scandals and Rossdale's career waning, the iconic rock couple's marriage just couldn't take it anymore and they divorced in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sean-penn-and-madonna>Sean Penn and Madonna</h2><p>Sean Penn is notorious in Hollywood for his terrible temper. The actor normally tries to stay out of the spotlight but has found himself in tabloid headlines time and again facing abuse allegations. Whether it is toward his partner of the moment, paparazzi, or someone he views as an enemy, Penn is apparently not afraid to use violence to express himself. So it's no wonder that his marriage to Madonna ended poorly after just 2 years of marriage. Along with physical outbursts, Penn apparently also often flew into jealous rages and drove drunk. All of these things combined with tons of rumors that he was cheating on her finally led to Madonna filing for divorce. Though this break up happened way back in the mid 80s, it is still remembered as one of the most tumultuous ever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=princess-diana-and-prince-charles>Princess Diana and Prince Charles</h2><p>Celebrities are already under enough scrutiny but royals have it even worse. As the family who is responsible for ruling a country, they are expected to act perfect 24/7, which just isn't reality. Combine having every second of their lives analyzed and a doomed relationship from the start and you have the heartbreaking story of Prince Charles and Princess Diana. Though Diana was perhaps the most loved royal of our time, "The People's Princess" was not really her husband's first choice for a wife. Rumor had it that Charles' future wife Camilla Parker Bowles was his true love and that he carried out an affair with her during the entirety of his marriage to Diana. Though divorce was considered a major scandal for royalty, the pair didn't care and called it quits in 1996.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=justin-timberlake-and-britney-spears>Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears</h2><p>I for one was absolutely all in with Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears' relationship. The two young pop idols topped the charts when they got together and were considered a music power couple. Not to mention that they were both attractive and at the same time seemingly wholesome as a pair. After appearing everywhere together, including in their iconic denim outfits, the couple decided to break up in 2002, much to the chagrin of fans. One source of strife in the relationship was their sex life, with the couple claiming to be pure but rumors of hot and heavy activities behind the scenes. Claims that Spears cheated on Timberlake, which the crooner referenced in his song "Cry Me A River" were also a major reason for the split. RIP my childhood!</p><h2 id=reese-witherspoon-and-ryan-phillippe>Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Phillippe</h2><p>During the teen movie boom of the late 90s, tons of new celebs came on the scene, filling Hollywood with hot, talented young actors. Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Phillippe emerged as stars with real potential after starring together in "Cruel Intentions." The young celebs fell in love and got married quickly. The pair were together from 1999 to 2006 and had a few kids but then things fell apart for them. Tabloids ran stories that Phillippe was hooking up with his "Stop Loss" co-star Abby Cornish. Though the pair claims that they were just too young when they got married, these cheating rumors really got to them. They were even seen publicly fighting at the premiere of "Flags of Our Fathers." Well, they were a super cute pair while they lasted!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sandra-bullock-and-jesse-james>Sandra Bullock and Jesse James</h2><p>Sandra Bullock and Jesse James were a show biz couple that had me scratching my head from the start. How does a seasoned actress end up with a motorcycle customizer turned reality star? The differences between them really came to a head in 2010 when Bullock won her Academy Award for "The Blind Side." At the Oscars, James acted like the gushing husband but just 8 days later, rumors emerged that he was having an affair with tattoo model Michelle McGee. As if cheating on his wife wasn't enough of a scandal, creepy photos of James soon popped up, too. He was shown wearing Nazi garb and doing the "heil" gesture. These gossip stories were the beginning of the end for what was just days before a smiling, seemingly happy couple. Bullock filed for divorce later in the year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-cruise-and-nicole-kidman>Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman</h2><p>I know, I know, Tom Cruise again. But his marriages have really been rumor bait! When the actor married Nicole Kidman in 1990 after less than a year of dating, the couple quickly became one of the most talked about couples in Hollywood. They were both young, successful, and attractive, so people wanted to hear news about the pair whether it was true or not. In fact, there was so much gossip printed about Kidman and Cruise that they engaged in a number of lawsuits against the press. However, the duo finally gave in to the pressures of the media and split up in 2001. Many sources say that Scientology was to blame for this divorce, too, because Kidman wasn't into it. Leah Remini even claims that Kidman is considered a "suppressive person" by the Church of Scientology, which reflects the couple's major differences of opinion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=richard-gere-and-cindy-crawford>Richard Gere and Cindy Crawford</h2><p>There are tons of funny, strange, and just plain gross rumors about celebrities floating around the internet. Most of them are simply ignored by the star in question, but the one about Richard Gere is too wild to ignore. I'm not sure how it began, but many people believe that Gere has a strange sexual fetish where he enjoys putting small rodents like gerbils in his butt. Say what?! The actor has denied the rumor many times, but I wonder if it contributed to his breakup with model Cindy Crawford. She is much younger than him and was probably totally embarrassed by these stories of her husband! Though the pair claims that they just grew apart, I can't help but wonder how much crazy rumors like this one contributed to their split. No one wants to be associated with a weirdo!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hugh-grant-and-elizabeth-hurley>Hugh Grant and Elizabeth Hurley</h2><p>Oh my. Hugh Grant is one of the dreamiest actors alive but was an even hotter commodity in the 90s. With his smooth British accent and good looks, he could have had any woman he wanted. That's why he got married to an equally gorgeous and talented woman, actress Elizabeth Hurley. However, for some reason he wanted to pay for his women. The actor was caught getting down and dirty in a car with a sex worker in 1995 and was even arrested. Though the pair tried to stick it out, their relationship just couldn't withstand this scandal plus other rumors of Grant's womanizing ways. The two broke up in 2000 but remain friends, with Grant even acting as godfather to Hurley's son.</p><h2 id=zac-efron-and-vanessa-hudgens>Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens</h2><p>Another relationship that was a dream come true for fans was Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens. The two cuties came on the scene as the stars of Disney Channel's "High School Musical" and its subsequent sequels. Their onscreen chemistry was undeniable so the pair began dating in real life, too. After a five year relationship, the duo split up in 2010 after a major rocky patch. As two teen idols, there were always rumors of their infidelity, but it was the female fans that pushed Hudgens over the edge. So many female fans chased after Zac and he gave them attention right back. But Hudgens didn't see this as just being nice to supporters, so she got majorly jealous. It was ultimately this jealous and worry over Zac cheating with fans that ended the relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=woody-allen-and-mia-farrow>Woody Allen and Mia Farrow</h2><p>Woody Allen and Mia Farrow's relationship seems to have been rocky from the very start. Some sources claim that this is because Farrow got randomly dumped by the love of her life, Frank Sinatra, married her rebound man Andre Previn a year later, then began dating Allen a year after that divorce. Rumor has it that although the couple's only biological child Ronan was born in 1987, well into their relationship, that he was actually Sinatra's child. Allegations of sexual abuse against his adopted kids often popped up against Allen in the tabloids. When rumors and evidence of a relationship between Soon-Yi Previn, Mia's adopted daughter from her previous marriage, and Allen came to light, it was the final straw. Farrow broke up with Allen in 1992 and no longer sees Soon-Yi, as she chose being married to Allen over being a part of Farrow's family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kristen-stewart-and-robert-pattinson>Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson</h2><p>Much to the delight of Twilight fans everywhere, Bella and Edward (aka Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson) were a couple in real life as well as on screen. Even though the two shy stars tried their hardest to stay out of the spotlight, their romance couldn't escape the paparazzi. However, in 2012 Us Weekly published a series of photos showing Stewart in a car and on a nature trail with her "Snow White and the Huntsman" director Rupert Sanders. The two were shown kissing, hugging, and snuggling, so the gossip magazine obviously crafted a good affair story to go with the photos. Stewart apologized publicly to Pattinson and the relationship was back on for awhile, only to break up the next year. These two just couldn't weather the breakup rumors and decided to make them come true.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tiger-woods-and-elin-nordegren>Tiger Woods and Elin Nordegren</h2><p>Though he was one of the best golfers and most recognizable professional athletes in the world, Tiger Woods kept himself out of the tabloids for a long time. However, that all changed in 2009. Though the world didn't know of the cheating rumors yet, Woods' wife Elin Nordegren did. She chased him out of the house, yelling and swinging a golf club at him. When Woods tried to get away, he ended up crashing his new car into bushes. Ouch! So what was the cause of all this drama? As it turns out, Woods loves the ladies and kept a few mistresses on the side of his marriage. 13 women ended up coming forward claiming to have slept with Woods, though we can't be sure how many of those stories are true. No matter the number, Nordegren wasn't having it!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=josh-duhamel-and-fergie>Josh Duhamel and Fergie</h2><p>Singer Fergie and actor Josh Duhamel started their relationship in a super cute way. He told a magazine in an interview that he had a dream about Fergie, the singer met up with him and mentioned the interview, and the rest is history. The couple seemed like they were really going to go the distance but ultimately broke off their marriage after 8 years together. Why? Well, one of the major scandals that rocked their relationship was a cheating rumor that popped up about Duhamel in 2009, the same year the pair got married. While he was shooting a movie in Atlanta, tabloids say, Duhamel visited a strip club and hooked up with one of the dancers, Nicole Forrester. Though the couple stayed together for years afterwards, this surely created trust problems that led to the marriage's demise.</p><h2 id=alex-rodriguez-and-cynthia-scurtis>Alex Rodriguez and Cynthia Scurtis</h2><p>The most exciting part about this break up story is not who was in the relationship, but who the cheating was with. Former Yankees baseball star Alex Rodriguez is good looking and had the largest contract in Major League Baseball, making him attractive to fans and celebrities alike. Over the years he has dated a number of stars, but his romance with Madonna was one of the most talked about. Why? For starters, they got together when Rodriguez was still married to Cynthia Scurtis. When rumors of the affair between the baseball player and singer turned out to be true, that was the last straw for the marriage according to Scurtis. In fact, she took herself on vacation to Paris so she wouldn't blow up at her husband over the whole ordeal!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpaWKwprjEm6pmq59is7OtxqKjnmWkna61edOhnLJlnJrBbr7UpqauqqNirqeyxJyrZqyYmrpw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrities-who-do-not-believe-in-marriage.html><span>←</span><span>10 Celebrities Who Do Not Believe In The Institution Of Marriage</span></a>
