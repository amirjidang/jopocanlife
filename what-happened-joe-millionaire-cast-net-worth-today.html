Back in 2003, however, there was another dating show that people were very interested in, Joe Millionaire. After all, when the first season of Joe Millionaire aired, the show became a sensation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything To Know About Netflix's New Reality Show Dated And Related</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately, the second season of Joe Millionaire was a flop and the show was canceled. To the surprise of many, <a href=#>a new season of Joe Millionaire recently aired</a> and while <a href=#>the show certainly could be awkward</a>, it captivated many viewers.</p><p>Since so many people are now Joe Millionaire fans again, there are a lot of viewers who want to know what the guys who have starred in the show are up to now and how rich they are.</p><h2 id=where-is-the-original-joe-millionaire-now>Where Is The Original Joe Millionaire Now?</h2><p>When the first season of Joe Millionaire was produced, a group of women were led to believe they would be vying for the affections of an extremely rich man. To pull off that feat, the show was filmed in a mansion, and a man posed as the butler of the show’s star who was looking for love.</p><p>As it turned out, however, the show explained the eligible bachelor named Evan Marriott actually was a working-class construction worker who was far from wealthy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Joe Millionaire's Evan Marriott Has Been Up To</a></span></p><p>Once Joe Millionaire became a hit, members of the media began looking into the backgrounds of everyone involved. As a result, it was discovered that in addition to being a construction worker, Evan Marriott also worked as a model. Still, Marriott definitely wasn’t anywhere close to as rich as the show led the ladies to believe.</p><p>At the end of Joe Millionaire’s first season, Evan Marriott decided he wanted to be in a relationship with Zora Andrich. Since she decided to stay with Evan at the end of the season when his true wealth was revealed, Marriott and Andrich were awarded a $1 million prize. Unfortunately, the couple didn’t stay together for long so they wound up splitting the prize money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to celebritynetworth.com, it seems like Evan Marriott did pretty good with his prize money since they report that he now has a $1.5 million fortune. As Marriott once revealed, he expanded his riches by taking his prize money and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">investing in a heavy-equipment rental-contracting company</a> in Orange County.</p><p>In the years since he became a business owner, Marriott has mostly led an anonymous and private life. On top of having more money than he had when Joe Millionaire was filmed, Marriott also looks very different today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the second season of Joe Millionaire, a man named David Smith took over the role Evan Marriott vacated. Unfortunately, since the second season flopped, there aren’t too many people who are interested in what Smith is up to now. Almost certainly for that reason, nothing is really known about Smith’s whereabouts or activities.</p><h2 id=where-are-kurt-f-sowers-and-steven-mcbee-from-joe-millionaire-for-richer-or-poorer-now>Where Are Kurt F. Sowers and Steven McBee From Joe Millionaire: For Richer Or Poorer Now?</h2><p>After Joe Millionaire ceased production almost two decades earlier, a new season premiered at the beginning of 2022. Unlike past seasons, the newest version of Joe Millionaire starred two men, one of which was said to be rich.</p><p>By the end of the season, Kurt F. Sowers and Steven McBee both supposedly found love while filming Joe Millionaire: For Richer or Poorer.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>FOX's Most Deceptive Reality Show Scored 35 Million Viewers</a></span></p><p>Fortunately for everyone involved, Joe Millionaire: For Richer Or Poorer Now was a hit. However, the show wasn’t anywhere close to the kind of sensation the original season of Joe Millionaire was in the early 2000s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It makes sense that the most reputable publications like Forbes and celebritynetworth.com haven’t reported on how much money Kurt F. Sowers and Steven McBee have. However, that doesn’t mean nothing is known about either men’s fortunes.</p><p>Even though Joe Millionaire: For Richer or Poorer revealed that Steven McBee was the real millionaire, both of the show’s stars are business leaders. In fact, even Wikipedia states that Kurt F. Sowers and McBee both are CEOs of different companies.</p><p>With that in mind, it makes sense that according to thecinemaholic.com, both men have a good amount of money but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the gap in their net worths is sizable</a>. After all, the website reports that Sowers is worth just short of $1 million and McBee’s fortune is around $10 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the end of Joe Millionaire: For Richer or Poorer, Kurt F. Sowers and Steven McBee walked away in relationships with Amanda Pace and Calah Jackson respectively.</p><p>Unfortunately for anyone who wanted to see both couples stay together, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">both pairs split up before long</a>. In Sower’s case, he announced he was single mere days after the finale of Joe Millionaire: For Richer or Poorer aired. McBee and Jackson stayed together a while longer but in May of 2022, they also went their separate ways.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZ%2B8pnnMoqOloZ%2Bjrqq%2BxGaamqukYrumwIywpqusmGLBsLDAsmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-did-veronica-youngblood-do-virginia-mom-convicted-over-murder-of-two-daughters-606744-html.html><span>←</span><span>What did Veronica Youngblood do?
