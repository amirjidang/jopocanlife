He sat down lately with the Sunday Times of London to talk about his freshly-released movie Stillwater and dropped an extremely odd story about how <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he quit saying the f-slur only "months ago."</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Are Seeing Parallels Between The Careers Of Britney Spears And Taylor Swift</a></span></p><p>"The word that my daughter calls the 'f-slur for a homosexual' was commonly used when I was a kid, with a different application," he defended himself.</p><p>In fact, the actor is no stranger to controversies, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans aren't buying it</a>. To sum them up, here's what we know about Matt Damon's recent cancellation and his past.</p><h2 id=a-conversation-with-his-daughter-stopped-him-from-using-the-f-slur-again><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>A Conversation With His Daughter Stopped Him From Using The F-Slur Again</span></h2><p>While eating a meal with his family, the father of four dropped the f slur, which upset one of his daughters. After a long conversation, she inspired him to stop using the word.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I made a joke, months ago, and got a treatise from my daughter. She left the table. I said, ‘Come on, that’s a joke! I say it in the movie 'Stuck on You!’ She went to her room and wrote a very long, beautiful treatise on how that word is dangerous. I said, ‘I retire the f-slur!’ I understood," he said, in his own words.</p><h2 id=he-claimed-he-s-never-used-the-derogatory-term-in-his-personal-life><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He Claimed He's Never Used The Derogatory Term In His Personal Life</span></h2><p>However, in response to the recent backlash, the actor claimed that he's never used the term against anyone in his "personal life," despite the interview suggesting otherwise.</p><p>"I have never called anyone 'f****t' in my personal life and this conversation with my daughter was not a personal awakening. I do not use slurs of any kind," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-s-then-addressed-his-support-for-the-lgbtq-community><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He's Then Addressed His Support For The LGBTQ+ Community</span></h2><p>Furthermore, The Martian actor added that he's supported the LGBTQ+ community amidst the backlash.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christian Bale Is Completely Unrecognizable In ‘Thor: Love And Thunder’</a></span></p><p>"Given that open hostility against the LGBTQ+ community is still not uncommon, I understand why my statement led many to assume the worst. To be as clear as I can be,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> I stand with the LGBTQ+ community,</a>" he continued in a statement to Yahoo Entertainment.</p><h2 id=glaad-gay-amp-lesbian-alliance-against-defamation-has-released-a-statement-regarding-damon-s-latest-comments><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) Has Released A Statement Regarding Damon's Latest Comments</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In response, GLAAD issued a statement regarding the actor's "retirement" from the f-slur and the recent backlash. As written by Anthony Allen Ramos, the NGO's Head of Talent, what happened is an "important reminder that this word, or any word that aims to disparage and disrespect LGBTQ people, has no place in mainstream media, social media, classrooms, workplaces, and beyond."</p><p>"There needs to be accountability at a time when anti-LGBTQ slurs remain rampant today and can fuel discrimination and stereotypes, especially when used by those outside of the community to defame or describe LGBTQ people," he addressed further.</p><h2 id=he-once-made-a-controversial-remark-on-the-metoo-movement><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Once Made A Controversial Remark On The #MeToo Movement</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That said, the actor isn't quite safe from controversies. Back in 2018, Damon found himself in hot water after his comments on sexual assault amidst the height of the Time's Up & #MeToo movements. The actor said that in this "watershed moment," people should acknowledge the "spectrum of behavior" when it comes to sexual misconduct and pay attention to men who have not been accused of such predatory behavior instead.</p><h2 id=a-month-later-the-actor-apologized><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>A Month Later, The Actor Apologized</span></h2><p>Not too long after the statement went public, the actor took time to address it and apologize. In an interview with Kathie Lee Gifford on the Today show, he said that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he regretted his comments</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I really wish I’d listened a lot more before I weighed in on this," he apologized. "A lot of those women are my dear friends and I love them and respect them and support what they’re doing and want to be a part of that change ... But I should get in the back seat and close my mouth for a while."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Megan Fox Changed Her Life Forever By Cutting Out This One Thing</a></span></p><h2 id=he-also-made-a-controversial-statement-on-diversity-during-project-greenlight-in-2015><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He Also Made A Controversial Statement On Diversity During 'Project Greenlight' In 2015</span></h2><p>Three years prior to the controversial remarks on #MeToo, the actor was thrown under the bus for his comments on diversity during an episode of Project Greenlight. The series itself is a reality show that pits first-time filmmakers being given a chance to direct a feature film. He told Dear White People producer Effie Brown, who is a black woman, that diversity isn't his problem, saying, "You do it in the casting of the film, not in the casting of the show."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-issued-another-apology><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Issued Another Apology</span></h2><p>"My comments were part of a much broader conversation about diversity in Hollywood and the fundamental nature of ‘Project Greenlight’ which did not make the show," he said in a statement to Variety. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I am sorry that they offended some people,</a> but, at the very least, I am happy that they started a conversation about diversity in Hollywood."</p><h2 id=matt-damon-s-new-film-stillwater-faces-conflict><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Matt Damon's New Film 'Stillwater' Faces Conflict</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking of which, his recent film Stillwater also isn't safe from controversy. The film is based on Amanda Knox's story, an innocent American woman who spent four years in an Italian prison for the conviction of the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher, a fellow exchange student.</p><p>"Why is my name used to refer to events I had no hand in?" Knox wrote in an essay on Medium,<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">which she also shared on Twitter</a>. "I return to these questions because others continue to profit off my name, face, and story without my consent."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth Behind Emily Blunt & Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson’s Unlikely Friendship</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWdlsG1ecOapKimXZyytcDIp55mm5GjsKa4y56bZqCVp7K0edahmK1lp5p6rLrOsGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-emily-cox-pregnant-details-to-know-about-her-children.html><span>←</span><span>Is Emily Cox Pregnant?
