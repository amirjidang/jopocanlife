So, I did a pretty good job entertaining people.”</p><p>The rapper currently <a href=#>has seven-figure debt</a>, which may&nbsp;explain his need to admit to using fake money in social media posts. Tekashi owes $1 million to robbery victims involved in the 2018 criminal case in which he snitched on former friends to get a reduced sentence.</p><p>Last month, Tekashi submitted a declaration to the court in which he claimed he doesn’t have money to pay back the restitution at this moment.</p><p>“Right now, I am struggling to make ends meet,” he said, court documents reveal, <a href=#>All Hip Hop</a> reports. “I do not know if I will ever command the kind of advances I was paid before my arrest, and my career stalled.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of that, Tekashi may find he owes even more money if a new lawsuit doesn’t work out in his favor.&nbsp;Last week, we reported that <a href=#>Tekashi is being sued By Streamusic for $2 million</a> after skipping out on several scheduled performances.</p><p>The music app had enlisted Tekashi to play two shows in Hollywood in December 2021, for which they would pay him $150,000. But the company claims he ghosted them when they reached out to ask him to promote the shows on social media in the week before.</p><p>Streamusic claims he negotiated with them to re-schedule the concerts for the following month, which he apparently also failed to follow through with. Now, the company is seeking $2 million in damages and for breach of contract.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite his ongoing legal troubles, Tekashi is planning to release a new album, which he teased earlier this month on his Instagram page. "THE DEMON IS BACK APRIL 15TH. I’m THE BEAST they couldn’t contain. The industry most hated animal,” he wrote. “APRIL 15th the KING OF NEW YORK IS COMING BACK. I’m going back home.”</p><p>Tekashi’s legal cases remain ongoing.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Russell Wilson & Ciara Buy $25 Million Colorado Mansion, List Washington Estates</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>All Hip Hop</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OeopqrmJ56p63KnmSmp56axm6%2FzpygmqRdorKltcBmpKKknJ68r7%2BMnZybrF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./susan-geston-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Susan Geston Wiki, Age of Jeff Bridges Wife, Family, Ethnicity, Nationality, Biography, Kids &amp;amp; Mo</span></a>
