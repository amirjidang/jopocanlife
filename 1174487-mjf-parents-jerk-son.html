And he comes back to dinner with nothing [on] but a sock …”</p><p>“And that’s Max. He’s a jerk, but he’s funny. He garners attention. And I spit my food out all over the table.”</p><p>From playdates as a kid to his time on the high school gridiron, Max’s parents have plenty of stories that Stewart shares in the piece of him always being the MJF smart-ass fans (and media) are used to seeing up close and personal. MJF recalls the frustrating and concerning time when he dropped out of college to pursue pro wrestling.</p><p>“My dad just stares at me, and goes, “What the [expletive] are you doing here?” Friedman recalls. “To which my response was, ‘Hey, I knew I wasn’t supposed to be there. I know what I want to be.’ My dad looked at me and said, ‘What do you want to be?’ I said I want to be a pro wrestler.’”</p><p>He exhaled, looked down at the ground for a solid three minutes straight, looked up at me and said, ‘Well, if you’re going to do it you’re going to do it right, and you’re not allowed to quit and if you do quit you’re not allowed to live here.’ And he went to bed.”</p><p>His parents wound up deciding to give Max the same four years they gave Alex and Carlee for college to try to make it in the wrestling business. They’re glad they did.</p><p>You can read the <a href=#>entire piece by going here</a>, which includes stories from his mother, sister, Jim Ross and his football coach as they all cite the conceitedness of Maxwell Jacob Friedman.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZBwa21wZ2K6q7KMqZirnZ6pwG62xKuiZqufow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mia-khalifa-playboy-deal-for-her-support-of-palestine-1234800490.html><span>←</span><span>Mia Khalifa Loses Playboy Deal For Her Support Of Palestine</span></a>
