Nine days later, Jones turned heads at the listening party for West’s album, Donda 2, bearing <a href=#>a striking resemblance to Kardashian</a> in an all-black catsuit, knee-high boots and blue glasses. On February 14, Us Weekly confirmed that West had <a href=#>split from the Uncut Gems actress</a> after less than two months of dating.</p><p>“Julia and Kanye remain good friends and collaborators but they are no longer together,” a representative for the actress told Us at the time.</p><p>His relationship with Jones, however, was just heating up.

The producer has famously gifted both Kardashian and Fox Birkin bags during their relationships.

It was purchased from Privé Porter at Jones’ request: “It’s one of the most famous and sought after Birkins in the world,” CEO of Privé Porter, <strong>Michelle Berk</strong>, told Entertainment Tonight. “The demand is because of the beauty and uniqueness of the bag — as well as the limited production numbers.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to find out more about West and Jones’ relationship:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKK62J5ksJ2jqXqiusNmmqGZnprGbrbOp5ysZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXq1tcyeo6KmlWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./julio-macias-height-age-boyfriend-biography-wiki-net-worth-1406-html.html><span>←</span><span>Julio Macias Height, Age, Boyfriend, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth</span></a>
