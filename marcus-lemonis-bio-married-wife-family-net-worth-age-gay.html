He, however, grew up in Miami where he attended Christopher Columbus High School. After that, the future entrepreneur headed to Milwaukee where he attended Marquette University. He studied political science, criminology, and economics at the university where he later graduated in 1995. Upon leaving college, Marcus Lemonis went to work for his grandfather. He spent some years in the company during which he rose to a managerial position. He, however, quit that comfortable post after his mentor, Lee Lacocca, advised him to go into RV (recreational vehicle) business.</p><p>Lacocca also fronted him a start-up loan and he was able to acquire an RV company known as Holiday RV Superstore. Lemonis thereafter founded his own company known as Freedom Roads and in 2006, he merged with Camping World. Camping World is a company that sells RVs, RVs parts and offers maintenance). Marcus Lemonis now sits atop an RV business empire worth $3 billion. He has received several accolades for his impact in the RV industry, more so, Ernst & Young named him Entrepreneur of the Year in 2008.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=family></span><strong>Family</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lemonis was not born in America but rather in Beirut, Lebanon. His biological father was a Lebanese man named Abdallel while his biological mom was a Syrian lady named Nadia. At the time of his birth, Beirut was embroiled in a bitter civil war and his parents left him at an orphanage. This was most probably due to safety concerns. Lemonis thus spent the first nine months of his life in ‘limbo’ before a Miami-based couple adopted him. He subsequently grew up in Miami with his adoptive parents; Leo and Sophia Lemonis.</p><p>Marcus Lemonis developed an entrepreneurial spirit from an early age and this was due to his family background. His grandfather owned a car dealership and the family placed emphasis on a strong work ethic. Consequently, while most youngsters were busy going to camp or indulging in other recreational activities; Lemonis helped out in his family’s business. This work experience instilled an enterprising spirit in him and he started his very first business, a lawn mowing service, at the age of 12.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-he-married-wife-or-gay></span> <strong>Is He Married </strong><strong>(Wife) O</strong><strong>r Gay?</strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Marcus Lemonis is very much off the market. He is married to a fellow highflying entrepreneur named Bobbi Raffel. The couple first met in 2006 when Lemonis purchased a fashion business belonging to Raffel. They subsequently commenced a relationship and got engaged on the 25th of December 2017. The couple then tied the knot in February 2018. The beautiful ceremony took place at the Hotel Bel Air in Los Angeles.</p><p>Unlike many weddings where the bride is usually most excited, Marcus Lemonis was visibly elated during the nuptials. He shared numerous snaps from the ceremony on his official Instagram handle. He also described the day as a special and awesome day which moved him to tears. With regard to his sexuality, Lemonis is not gay as all of his past relationships have been with ladies. However, this does not mean that the entrepreneur harbors homophobic sentiments. He has previously disclosed that he doesn’t do business with bigots.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=marcus-lemonis-net-worth></span><strong>Marcus Lemonis’ Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Marcus Lemonis reportedly has a net worth of $900 million; however conservative estimates put his wealth at $150 million. Whichever it is, there is no doubt that the little child from a war-torn city has done well for himself. One factor that has helped to expand Lemonis’ business empire is the reality TV series, The Profit. Each episode involves him assisting a struggling company and giving it tips on how to survive the harsh economy.</p><p>Lemonis also invests his own money in the company in return for an ownership stake. As a result of this, he has been able to acquire interests in dozens of businesses including Unique Salon and Spa, Coopersburg Sports, My Big Fat Greek Gyro, Grafton Furniture, Flex Watches, etc. It is important to note that Lemonis is not all about the money. He has a philanthropic heart and supports several worthy causes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWRp7C2v4ylnKannp7Abq7IqGSmmaKntqawjLCgn51dm66utcuyZKedpGLEsL7ToWSan5VitKLFjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lil-nas-x-and-other-male-celebs-who-are-pushing-the-boundaries-of-fashion.html><span>←</span><span>Lil Nas X And 9 Other Male Celebs Who Are Pushing The Boundaries Of Fashion</span></a>
