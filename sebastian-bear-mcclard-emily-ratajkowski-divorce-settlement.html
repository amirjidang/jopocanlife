Emily is a New York Times best-selling author, model, and actress, making significantly more yearly money than her soon-to-be ex-husband. With the pair sharing a son, one-year-old Sylvester Apollo Bear, just how much will Sebastian be worth after his divorce from Emrata?</p><h2 id=did-emily-ratajkowski-and-sebastian-bear-mcclard-have-a-prenup>Did Emily Ratajkowski And Sebastian Bear-McClard Have A Prenup?</h2><p>It's unclear if Emily and Sebastian had a prenup. Emily has never confirmed if she and Sebastian have a prenup; she's also yet to deny that they don't have one. If the pair did not get a prenup, the division of their assets would rely on the pair's ability to split their livelihood amicably and the divorce laws within the state they were married to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple was married in New York State. There have been numerous rumors of infidelity on Sebastian's end as well. A source told Insider that Sebastian was a serial cheater, straying from his marriage on multiple occasions. The source said Sebastian even allegedly cheated on Emily while she was pregnant with their son.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adultery is still a crime in the state of New York</a> - punishable by time in jail. While only 13 people have served time behind bars since the 1970s for cheating on their spouse, technically, Sebastian could be arrested during the trial for cheating on Emily. If he did cheat on Emily during their marriage, not only is he a massive idiot, but it will also drastically affect how much money he's entitled to in the divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Emily Ratajkwoski Has Said About Being Linked To Brad Pitt</a></span></p><p>It wouldn't be surprising that Emrata and Sebastian didn't get a prenup. Their nuptials were somewhat rushed, eloping weeks after first being spotted together. Whether it's because they rushed down the aisle or they just believed their love was everlasting, <a href=#>numerous Hollywood couples have chosen to forgo a prenup</a>. If Emily and Sebastian didn't sign a prenup, they join the long list of divorced celebs who wish they did.</p><h2 id=how-much-was-sebastian-bear-mcclard-39-s-net-worth-before-marrying-emily-ratajkowski>How Much Was Sebastian Bear-McClard's Net Worth Before Marrying Emily Ratajkowski?</h2><p>Sebastian Bear-McClard wasn't a well-known public figure when he and Emily first began dating. Even now, he remains more mysterious to the world than his ex, having no social media profiles and rarely making comments to the press.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He's made quite a fortune while evading the spotlight. Working as a producer since 2006, his best-known projects are Uncut Gems, Good Time, and Bodies Bodies Bodies. However, all three of those works came out after his marriage to Emily. While we don't know Sebastian's exact net worth before meeting Emily, we can assume it was less than his net worth today.</p><p>An interesting tidbit of information about Sebastian producing Bodies, Bodies, Bodies is that his soon-to-be ex-wife's newest love starred in the movie - Pete Davidson. Sebastian and Pete are friends, or maybe were considering the latest developments between the actor and Emrata. The men were even pictured at a Knick's game in 2020 together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pete and Emily recently confirmed relationship rumors</a>, sitting front row together at Knick's game in Brooklyn, New York, in late November 2022. It's unclear how close Sebastian and Pete are or ever were, but things must be a little awkward now between the producer and SNL alum.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Did Pete Davidson Become Famous?</a></span></p><p>A source reports that while Emily and Pete are keeping things casual, Emily thinks the comedian is charismatic and funny. She likes that they're so comfortable with each other, with Emily reportedly saying Pete is a good rebound after her heartbreaking divorce.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-sebastian-bear-mcclard-39-s-net-worth-after-divorcing-emily-ratajkowski>How Much Is Sebastian Bear-McClard's Net Worth After Divorcing Emily Ratajkowski?</h2><p>According to Life&Style Magazine, <a href=#>Sebastian has a $12 million net worth as of 2022</a>. He's accumulated his fortune through his production endeavors. In 2014, he founded the independent film production studio Elara Pictures with Oscar Boysen, Ronald Bronstein, & Josh and Benny Safdie. The company has gone on to produce multiple award-winning and critically acclaimed pictures.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sebastian was ousted from the company in August 2022; however, shortly after, news broke about Emily leaving him. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sources claimed he was fired for complaints over his behavior</a>, but he denied the allegations to Page Six. The producer claims to have left the company on his own terms, taking time off to care for his sick mother.</p><p>We don't know if Sebastian and Emily had a prenup. Therefore, we don't know how much of that $12 million is his own. We also don't know if any of the money came from Emily.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Emily has a net worth of $8 million. The only real insight we have had into the couple's financials was when an NYC landlord sued them for not paying rent. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sebastian was accused of misusing a New York state law to protect starving artists</a> and avoid paying over $140,000 worth of rent.</p><p>According to the landlord, he stopped paying rent in 2017. Emily tried to defend Sebastian's actions while they were together. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She took to Twitter to remind people that he may not be as rich as they think</a> since he's an independent movie producer. Her Twitter response made it seem that she sincerely felt he was a starving artist, using the law rightfully.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple ended up moving out of the apartment, with Sebastian asking for $2 million to leave, according to a representative for the building. Months after they left, Emily purchased a $2 million home in Los Angeles for the couple.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqnpqRqMGqrc1mmZ6ZomK6pK%2FLmqmdZZWitq3FjKuYrZmaoLy4v8qiZJ2hpqS%2FpLGMrJytrJyauqa602g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jack-osbournes-divorce-changed-family-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>How Jack Osbourne's Divorce Changed The Famous Family Forever</span></a>
