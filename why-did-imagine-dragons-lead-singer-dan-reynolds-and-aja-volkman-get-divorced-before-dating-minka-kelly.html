From 2011 until 2022, he and Aja Volkman were married and raising their four kids Valentine, Coco Rae, Gia James, and Arrow together. Now they are co-parenting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After <a href=#>Minka Kelly and Trevor Noah broke up</a>, the Friday Night Lights actress began dating Dan Reynolds. The couple has been together since the fall of 2022. While Reynolds seems to be happy in his new relationship, the end of his marriage couldn't have been easy. Why did Dan Reynolds and Aja Volkman get divorced?</p><h2 id=why-did-the-imagine-dragons-lead-singer-dan-reynolds-divorce-aja-volkman>Why Did The Imagine Dragons Lead Singer Dan Reynolds Divorce Aja Volkman?</h2><p>Whenever Imagine Dragons has performed, the concerts aren't on the same level as <a href=#>Taylor Swift and Beyonce's massive tours</a>. Still, all that travel can present challenges in a relationship. When one person is home all the time and the other is hitting the road, they can feel distant from one another.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aja Volkman is the partner who filed for divorce</a> from Dan Reynolds, according to People. She hasn't explained the reason for the divorce. But since they are both musicians, fans can guess that busy schedules and long-distance could be the reason.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dan-reynolds-aja-volkman-1.jpg><p>While Reynolds is more famous since he is the lead singer of Imagine Dragons, Volkman is a member of a band called Nico Vega.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Really Happened Between Elon Musk And Talulah Riley And Are They Still Close After Divorcing Twice?</a></span></p><p>Although Reynolds was seen with Minka Kelly around the time that his divorce became public knowledge, there was no overlap. Us Weekly reported that the couple began dating in November 2022. And in September 2022, Volkman asked for a divorce.</p><p>In April 2023, Volkman posted on Instagram and expressed how tough this experience has been.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/aja-volkman.jpg><p>She explained, "Navigating being in a public space while going through all of the things we have been through this year has been hard for both Dan and I. There is nothing to be said about the fairness of that because we both chose to be on a stage as our career path, so it certainly comes with the territory."</p><p>Volkman also said that she didn't want to explain further. She said, "However, I've never spoken about the details of our marriage or separation or divorce.

In 2021, Reynolds shared that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the couple almost got divorced</a> once before in an interview with BBC.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Rachael Leigh Cook Almost Never Talks About Her Kids, But Here’s What We Know About Her Family Life Since Her Brutal Divorce From Daniel Gilles</a></span></p><p>The singer shared that in 2018, he and Volkman felt that their relationship was at a standstill. It had actually been seven months since they had talked to each other. Reynolds explained that she texted him and they realized that they wanted to stay married.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dan-reynolds-aja-volkman-2.jpg><p>He said, "the message said something like: 'I love you. I don't need to own you to love you. I can love you without expectations. She vocalised it with such generosity, it made me rethink everything."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reynolds said that he and Volkman had lunch together and everything seemed to be fine. He also asked her to marry him again. It sounds like they were excited about reuniting and felt good and hopeful about what was to come. This makes the news of their 2022 divorce even more heartbreaking.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kelly Clarkson Reveals She’s In Therapy To Process Traumatic Divorce From Brandon Blackstock</a></span></p><p>In 2018, during that breakup, Dan Reynolds was interviewed on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and talked about Aja Volkman. And his comments might explain why the couple did decide to get divorced in 2022.</p><p>He said, “Marriage is already difficult to begin with. Add a husband who’s gone 90 per cent of the year, doing something that I really believe in — it’s just tough. We’re just working through it, and we’re going to continue to co-parent together. I love her. She’s my best friend,”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dan-reynolds.jpg><p>While the pair got back together for a few years, they knew in 2022 that it wasn't going to work out. Since it seems like they tried really hard to stay married, that is really sad. Even though they haven't said exactly why things fell apart between them, Reynolds and Volkman did seem to put a lot of thought into the decision.</p><p>In September 2022, Dan Reynolds was interviewed on The Howard Stern Show. He said that divorce is upsetting because "All your friends invest in it. Your family invests in it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He continued that it's hard to explain elements of his personal life to the world, but he knows that people are interested since he wanted to become a well-known figure. Reynolds continued, "we are going to be great parents to our kids. Relationships are so complex. We were together over a decade."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dan-reynolds-1.jpg><p>While Dan Reynolds has said how hard it was to end his relationship, he and Minka Kelly appear to be in love. A source explained to Us Weekly, “Being back on the singles’ scene after long relationships has been a challenging adjustment for each of them, so they’re taking their time and easing into it as opposed to running before they can walk, so to speak. But so far, so good, and they’re having fun, getting along great.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aja Volkman doesn't seem to have dated anyone since divorcing her husband. She has posted a lot of photos of her children on her Instagram account. And in June 2023, she said that her band was busy recording music, and she was getting ready to move.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecimmKChnpp6pb7AoKanq12hsqKwjKygp5%2BVp3qlrc1mqZ6xnqS5pb%2BMmqWdZZGfrm7CzqWippmeYrSmwIydoK%2BnopiypXnBnp2oqpVisaLAyKeeZqWZo7iiecqeo6WxXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-the-richest-cast-member-of-bravos-rhoslc.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is The Richest Cast Member Of Bravos RHOSLC?</span></a>
