After being featured as a secondary character on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Scott Disick began <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">adding significant&nbsp;earnings to his already impressive wealth</a>, and has continued to expand on his income streams over the past several years. He is now worth an astounding $45 million, and has since crowned himself with the nickname 'The Lord'.&nbsp; Whether fans know him from his vitamin company, reality television, or through the restaurant&nbsp; he owns, they've most certainly become familiar with his name. Here's how Scott Disick generates this astronomical amount of money, and<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the various ways he enjoys spending&nbsp;his fortune</a>...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=earns-his-clothing-brand-called-talentless>Earns: His Clothing Brand Called 'Talentless'</h2><p>Scott Disick is a true entrepreneur at heart, and he knows how to expand and monetize on his fame. His exposure increased dramatically after years of appearing on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, with many fans commenting on his impeccable looks along the way. Seeing an opportunity to express his creative side and generate more income at the same time, Disick launched his clothing brand in 2018, naming it 'Talentless.' The name is based off all the slew of negativity that was hurled at him earlier on in his reality television career, when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many critics branded him as being 'talentless,</a>' and making assumptions that he would never be able to succeed. He has managed to hurl that stereotype back at all those who trolled him by seeing huge sales and lots of fanfare surrounding his fashion label.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Disick Gives Diamond Watches To Guests At His Lavish Birthday Party</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=spends-his-mega-mansion>Spends: His Mega Mansion</h2><p>Scott Disick doesn't just call himself "The Lord," he happens to live like one, too. He currently resides in a<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> massive $6 million mega mansion in Hidden Hills</a>, Los Angeles, and it's the kind of estate that most people's dreams are made of.</p><p>Scott has proudly selected his own furnishings and decor, and has even been featured in Architectural Digest for all his incredible styling choices. He states he has always been drawn to&nbsp;Italian mid-century designs, but for this home, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he opted for a more French mid-century aesthetic.</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">His home is a 5663 square foot estate </a>that&nbsp;features "five-bedrooms six bathrooms and a contemporary farmhouse. There's also an open chef's kitchen, two large master suites and an attached six-car garage." The backyard is meticulously landscaped and features an oversized infinity pool that is a huge feature for parties, and also a lot of fun for his children to enjoy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=earns-endorsements>Earns: Endorsements</h2><p>Social media has paid a lot of attention to every move Scott Disick makes, and that's evident when looking at his impressive fan following. He has a whopping 26.1 million followers on Instagram alone, making him an incredibly powerful, influential celebrity online. It's no secret that Scott Disick makes a whole lot of money by<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> endorsing other brands through social media campaigns</a>, and he takes pride in knowing these simple posts from his account are generating millions of dollars, both for the brand he is representing, and of course, for himself.</p><p>Disick has been engaged in a number of endorsement deals for various brands, some of which include Burger King, Balmain, and Calabasas Luxury Motorcars. He reportedly earns upwards of $20,000 for each sponsored Instagram post that he puts up on his account.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=spends-private-jets>Spends: Private Jets</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Disick loves to live in the lap of luxury</a>, and that's made evident with his frequent use of private jet planes. He refuses to fly on commercial planes and is often seen jet setting aboard some of the most luxurious private planes that fans have ever seen. In fact, since his split from Kourtney Kardashian, Scott has been spotted taking private jets with a number of his girlfriends, and has taken more flights in recent months than most people have gone on in their lifetime.</p><h2 id=earns-reality-tv>Earns: Reality TV</h2><p>When assessing Scott Disick's net worth, it's important to take a close look at his earnings on Keeping Up With The Kardashians. As one of the most-watched television shows of all-time, the series followed the lives of the Kardashian and Jenner clan and quite a few episodes put the focus on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tumultuous relationship shared by Scott and Kourtney</a>. Fans watched as he struggled with addiction, rehab, and many dramatic moments with Kourtney, taking Scott's character from the secondary role and prominently featuring the star on a number of episodes. He was making $500,000 per episode in 2017, and that figure increased dramatically during the last few years of filming, and especially for the finale of the show. The success of his appearance on this series also led to his very own spinoff called Flip It Like Disick.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=spends-massive-car-collection>Spends: Massive Car Collection</h2><p>Scott Disick is absolutely addicted to fast cars. He often posts images of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his fleet of incredible vehicles</a> on his social media channels, leaving fans to drool in awe and envy. He has bragged about his car collection many times, and it's quite easy to see why. His fleet includes an impressive array of luxury cars and supercars, including a Rolls Royce Drophead Convertible, a 458 Ferrari, and a Bentley Mulsanne. He also has an 812 Ferrari, a Shelby Cobra convertible, a Lamborghini Urus, and a Rolls Royce Dawn convertible, as well as a Range Rover that he absolutely adores.</p><h2 id=earns-paid-appearances>Earns: Paid Appearances</h2><p>Scott Disick loves to party, and is known to put on a dramatic and often explosive show of emotion if he parties too hard. This is all too much to resist for big corporations that are looking to generate more interest in their venues and events. He is one of the most sought-after celebrities for paid appearances, and of course, when he's paid to appear at a special event, the organizers are not-so-secretly hoping that he'll show up with a few members of the Kardashian and Jenner clan as well. Disick has reportedly earned <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">upwards of $80,000 for a single nightclub appearance</a>, dating back to 2016, and is sure to charge significantly more than that at this current time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=spends-his-appearance>Spends: His Appearance</h2><p>Scott Disick loves putting his best face forward in every sense of the word. A good chunk of his fortune is spent on self-care and in maintaining his overall appearance. Disick uses a variety of expensive, top of the line beauty products, including&nbsp;Crème de la Mer by La Mer, which is is one of the most expensive face creams in the world, at $190 for just one ounce.</p><p>He doesn't cut any corners with his attire, either. He's been known to dress head to toe in top of the line labels such as Tom Ford, Gucci, an Louis Vuitton. His custom made suits cost upwards of $5,000 each, and Scott routinely wears simple shirts valued at well over $680.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=earns-inherited-wealth>Earns: Inherited Wealth</h2><p>In advance of becoming a reality television star that was able to develop his own income streams, Scott Disick was doing just fine, financially. He was born into a wealthy family, and had always enjoyed a privileged lifestyle. His father and grandfather were prominent real estate developers that had attained quite a bit of wealth during the course of their careers, and it was estimated that his mother and daughter were worth $25 million at the time of their death. Scott was their only child, and after they both passed away within 3 months of one another in 2013, Scott was the beneficiary of most of their fortune, alongside his surviving grandparents.</p><h2 id=spends-bling-and-watches>Spends: Bling And Watches</h2><p>Of course, no outfit is complete without the proper accessories, and as you may have guessed, Scott Disick splurges in this area, too. He spends a great deal of time selecting the best watch to compliment his outfit, and with options like his Patek Philippe Nautilus model that costs well over $80,000, or his Richard Mille 030 automatic time piece which set him back over $250,000, he's sure to make a great choice. Scott Disick also owns a variety of<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> blinged-out diamond </a>pendants, chains, and bracelets, all of which are rotated and selected to reflect the mood he is in when he gets dressed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Television Supremacy: The Famous Faces That Made A Fortune From Reality TV</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Life & Style</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">International Business Times</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pop Culture</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicki Swift</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e5BpZLCZqah6tK%2FOratmnJmotqS3jJ6Yq6ajYsCxsc2dqmagmah6rrXLpaCopqNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-athletes-who-suffered-brain-injuries-from-playing-their-sports.html><span>←</span><span>10 Athletes Who Suffered Severe Brain Damage</span></a>
