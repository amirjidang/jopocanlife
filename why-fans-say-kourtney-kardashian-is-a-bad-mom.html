The show has also included other intimate moments, such as the birth of Kourtney, Khloe and Kylie's children. Their sister, Kim, is also mother to four children whom she conceived with global rap star Kanye West, while Rob Kardashian has one child. However, as fans have watched the family grow up on their screens over the course of more than a decade, many have developed some strong opinions on some of their parenting skills.</p><h2 id=both-kylie-and-kourtney-have-built-families-of-their-own>Both Kylie And Kourtney Have Built Families Of Their Own</h2><p>During the earlier seasons of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, fans got an extremely intimate view into Kourtney and Scott Disick's relationship. The pair dated for a total of nine years, and during that time, they decided to start a family of their own.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although separated, they have three children together who were conceived during their relationship: Mason, Penelope and Reign. The birth of Mason was documented on Season 4 of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, giving fans an inside look at the much cherished moment.</p><p>Kylie, who is eighteen years younger than her sister Kourtney, has also started a family of her own with Travis Scott. Despite being young when she started a family, it seems as though Kylie has always had her heart set on wanting to be a mother from a young age.</p><p>These sentiments are echoed in a video that the fashion mogul posted on YouTube, documenting her first child's birth. In the video, her friends explain that Kylie has said that she 'always wanted to be a mom', and that she's wanted them 'since she was fifteen'.</p><p>In other interviews, she has also expressed that she felt twenty-five was the age that she hoped she would have children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her wish came true in February 2018. When the young socialite was just twenty years old, she gave birth to her first baby girl, Stormi, breaking the internet into a wild frenzy. Four years later in February 2022, Kylie gave birth to her second baby, who was initially called Wolf Webster.</p><p>However, the couple later announced that they had changed his name, meaning that his name is no longer Wolf. The new name has not been officially revealed.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Travis Scott Says He Never Cheated On Kylie Jenner, But A Fan Claims To Have Receipts">Travis Scott Says He Never Cheated On Kylie Jenner, But A Fan Claims To Have Receipts</a></span></p><p><a href=#>Kylie has also opened up about her struggles post-pregnancy</a> on an episode of The Kardashians, stating that she 'couldn't stop crying' for three weeks after her latest pregnancy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also expressed similar sentiments on an Instagram story, stating: “Postpartum has not been easy," and that the experience for her personally has been a little harder than with her daughter.”</p><h2 id=some-fans-don-39-t-agree-with-kourtney-39-s-parenting-style>Some Fans Don't Agree With Kourtney's Parenting Style</h2><p>Of course, eagle-eyed fans are best known for their abilities to pick up on small snippets of information and clues.
