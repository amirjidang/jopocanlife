Despite this, it was not good always for Leonardo. In fact, he was born into an impoverished family. His dad died five months before he was born.&nbsp;Since his mom could not afford a child, she gave him away to an orphanage. Leonardo started off as an apprentice with a dye maker in Milan, Italy. Soon, however, he was making spectacle parts. He moved to Agordo in Belluno, because the Italian eyewear industry was located here. It was here that he formed the company Luxottica. He started selling eyeglass frames in 1967, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Luxottica now owns and operates more than 6000 stores around the world. Over the years, the company has acquired several brands once the company was listed in New York and the Milan stock exchanges. He owns chains like the LensCrafters and Sunglass Hut and brands like Oakley and Ray-Ban. Claudio, the son of Leonardo, owns the American retailer for men, Brooks Brothers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=earnings-amp-financial-data>Earnings & Financial Data</h2><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Date</p></th><th scope=col><p>Category</p></th><th scope=col><p>Description</p></th><th scope=col><p>Amount</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>2019</p></td><td><p>Asset</p></td><td><p>Purchase value of Leonardo del Vecchio's yacht Moneikos and Gulfstream G550 private jet</p></td><td><p>$90,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2016</p></td><td><p>Salary</p></td><td><p>Fixed remuneration as the Executive Chairman of the Luxottica Group SpA</p></td><td><p>$1,250,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2016</p></td><td><p>Asset</p></td><td><p>Purchase value of Leonardo del Vecchio's 11-story office and retail building just off Fifth Avenue in New York City</p></td><td><p>$73,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2015</p></td><td><p>Earning Turned Donation</p></td><td><p>Donation of 140,000 shares of Luxottica stock to the company’s 8,000 employees in Italy</p></td><td><p>$10,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2011</p></td><td><p>Earning Turned Donation</p></td><td><p>Donation of shares of Luxottica stock to the company’s employees upon the company’s 50th anniversary</p></td><td><p>$7,700,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2001</p></td><td><p>Asset</p></td><td><p>Purchase value of the Sunglass Hut International , an operation with 1,962 stores, mostly in malls and shopping districts across the U.S.</p></td><td><p>$653,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1999</p></td><td><p>Asset</p></td><td><p>Purchase value of Bausch & Lomb 's Ray-Ban sunglass unit</p></td><td><p>$640,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1995</p></td><td><p>Asset</p></td><td><p>Purchase value of the LensCrafters chain, with 864 stores in the U.S. and Canada</p></td><td><p>$1,500,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1991</p></td><td><p>Sale of Asset</p></td><td><p>Sale of the U.S. Shoe business to Nine West</p></td><td><p>$600,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1990</p></td><td><p>Asset</p></td><td><p>Purchase value of U.S. Shoe, which also owned optical retail chain LensCrafters and women's apparel retailer Casual Corner</p></td><td><p>$1,400,000,000</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BvsdOwpqusmGSwprjEm6mirKlir7a%2FyKecrKtforKve8uepqeZopm8brDEpWSvnZOYtaq7jKecrWWnpL%2B1tI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lauren-sanchez-patrick-whitesell-havent-been-solid-for-a-while.html><span>←</span><span>Lauren Sanchez, Patrick Whitesell Havent Been Solid for a While</span></a>
