Recently, a patron at a steakhouse in Manchester, England, was treated to a £4,500, or $5,800, bottle of wine by mistake. According to the restaurant’s Twitter account, the customer had ordered a substantially less expensive bottle of wine that had a similar vintage to the 2001 Chateau le Pin Pomerol he was actually brought.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two bottles, which share a similar label, one being red and the other gold, also have somewhat similar names— Chateau Le Pin and Chateau Pichon Longueville.&nbsp;<a href=#>According to Metro</a>, the Chateau Pinchon Longueville is priced at £260, or $331, not cheap but significantly more affordable than the Chateau Le Pin.</p><p>Though it hasn’t been confirmed if the patron was finally charged the price of the Chateau Pinchon Longueville for the bottle or simply comped, it was still a great deal. The restaurant, which hoped the customer “enjoyed their evening,” seemed to confirm that the bartender managed to keep their job, tweeting, “To the member of staff who <a href=#>accidentally gave it away</a>, chin up! One-off mistakes happen and we love you anyway.” The restaurant, however, should perhaps consider not stocking $5,000 bottles of wine alongside less expensive vintages.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to CNN, the Chateau Le Pin, one of the most expensive bottles served in the restaurant, is listed in the “rarities” section of the wine list. Despite many cheaper wines receiving rave reviews, connoisseurs still seem to have a thing for exclusive vintages. According to Town and Country Magazine, 2018 was a record-breaking year for wine auctions.</p><p>Last October, Sotheby's sold a bottle of 1945 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti Romanee-Conti for <a href=#>an astounding $558,000</a> — more than 17 times the estimated price of $32,000. Wine producer Robert Drouhin went on to sell $7.3 million in wine from his personal cellar at the auction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The new world record established in today's sale is further proof that the <a href=#>demand for wine and spirits</a> of exceptional quality is at an all-time high, and that global collectors are willing to go the extra mile to acquire the rarest bottles of any kind," Jamie Ritchie, worldwide head of Sotheby's Wine, said.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Why Drinking The Right Amount Of Red Wine Is Actually Good For You</a></strong></p><p>Wine expert Jilly Goolden says most people wouldn’t know if they were drinking a $5,000 bottle of wine. Although it would understandably taste better than <a href=#>a house red</a>, it may taste unusual to many inexperienced wine drinkers since an 18-year-old wine is very different from what is available in most commercial wine shops. "It's a very old wine. It would look different and would probably have lost quite a lot of fruit - those drinking it might even have been disappointed," she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8BmqZ6rpJbCs63NrWSipl2au6i4wKebZpmTmLalsc2tmKWkqWLApr7Vnqpmm6WowbC5xKtkmmVlbX1xecGoq62klWK8p3nWoqWeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./8-wrestlers-who-sucked-in-mma-and-7-who-actually-could-fight.html><span>←</span><span>8 Wrestlers Who Sucked In MMA (And 7 Who Actually Could Fight)</span></a>
