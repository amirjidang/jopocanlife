She is also a businesswoman, producer, director, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">generous, dedicated philanthropist</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She has created a couple of charities - one is called 'Eva’s Heroes', which helps developmentally disabled children. The other is called the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eva Longoria Foundation</a>. This charity is designed to close the education gap among Latinx.</p><p>She uses her platform to bring social awareness to the issues she’s passionate about, from Latinx education to immigration to cancer research. She is one of the few actresses in Hollywood with a Master’s degree. It wasn’t given to her as an honorary master’s degree, because she gave a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">commencement speech</a>&nbsp;or something like that. She actually studied for three years to gain her degree in Chicano Studies.</p><p>Eva is a passionate, intelligent woman who isn’t interested in being known for one TV credit on her IMDb profile. She uses her influence to make money, but also to make the world a better place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=golden-globe-nominated-actress><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Golden Globe-Nominated Actress</span></h2><p>Eva Longoria is a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Globe</a> nominee. She was nominated in 2006 for 'Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series, Comedy, or Musical', for Desperate Housewives. Sadly, she did not take home the trophy, but it’s only a matter of time. Since the hit drama ended, she has been taking roles that challenge and excite her.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eva Longoria Set To Play Dora's Mother in 'Dora The Explorer'</a></span></p><h2 id=clothing-line><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Clothing Line</span></h2><p>In Spring 2017, Eva launched her very own clothing line on her website and on HSN. The clothing line featured spring dresses and menswear-inspired business apparel. She also released a leisurewear collection filled with joggers and fun t-shirts. Her clothing brand is very inclusive, with sizes ranging from 0 to 18.</p><h2 id=producer><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Producer</span></h2><p>Eva Longoria is an actress and a producer. She has been the executive producer of several television shows, films, award shows, and documentaries. She was the executive producer on Devious Maids, Grand Hotel, Telenovela, Mother Up!, Ours is a Future, Reversing Roe, and (surprisingly) John Wick.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eva Longoria And Victoria Beckham – Bestie Goals!</a></span></p><h2 id=modeling><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Modeling</span></h2><p>Once Eva became a household face and name, thanks to being on a hit TV show, she began to pose for magazine covers, photo spreads, and advertising campaigns. She's appeared in magazines all over the world. She has been on the cover of Vogue Mexico, Marie Claire, and Harper’s Bazaar.</p><h2 id=eva-s-kitchen-cooking-with-love-for-family-and-friends><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Eva's Kitchen: Cooking with Love for Family and Friends</span></h2><p>In April 2011, Eva released her first cookbook, called Eva's Kitchen: Cooking with Love for Family and Friends. She has yet to release another cookbook - instead, she's focusing on opening restaurants, launching her own clothing brand, directing, and acting. Sadly, she’s too busy to write another cookbook right now, but we really wish she would.</p><h2 id=tv-director><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>TV Director</span></h2><p>Eva has spent over a decade in the entertainment business and has learned a lot on set, including how to direct. She has directed several episodes of television shows, including Grand Hotel, Black-ish, The Mick, Jane the Virgin, Devious Maids, and many more. She is set to direct her first feature film, 24-7, in which she co-stars with Kerry Washington.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jane The Virgin: How Petra Stole The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=spokesperson><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Spokesperson</span></h2><p>Eva is a spokesmodel for several different brands. In 2007, she was the first spokesperson for Bebe Sport. She has been the face of L'Oréal Paris, New York & Co, Magnum Ice Cream, Heineken, and even Microsoft. In 2013, she became the spokesperson for Sheba cat food.</p><h2 id=restaurateur><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Restaurateur</span></h2><p>Eva is clearly very passionate about food. The Desperate Housewives star, like many celebrities, decided to get into the restaurant business. In 2008, she partnered with 'chef to the stars', Todd English, to open a restaurant called Beso in Hollywood, along with an adjacent nightclub. They opened another restaurant in Las Vegas which also had a nightclub above it.</p><h2 id=host><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Host</span></h2><p>The Empire guest star hosted the MTV Europe Music Video Awards in 2010. The show was shot in Madrid, Spain. Eva found an opening in between shooting Desperate Housewives, so she had time to host this awards show. It’s strange that an actress hosted this particular awards show. MTV usually asks a comedian or a musician to host.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=l-or-al-girl><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>L'Oréal Girl</span></h2><p>In 2005, Eva became a spokesperson for L'Oréal Paris. She was featured in several commercials, along with print ads. To this day, Eva is still a spokesperson and model for the brand. She recently filmed a video for IGTV where she dyed her hair at home. Plenty of us are dying our hair at home lately, right?</p><h2 id=guest-judge><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Guest Judge</span></h2><p>The Telenovela star was a guest judge on an episode of The Next Food Network Star, during season six in 2010. The remaining contestants had to cook a meal for Eva and her business partner chef, Todd English. The catch was they had to create a dish based on the emotion they were assigned. What a weird freaking challenge.</p><h2 id=shoe-designer><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Shoe Designer</span></h2><p>Eva not only has her own clothing line, but she also has a shoe line. She collaborated with online retailers, Eobuwie and Modivo; the collection is sadly exclusive to Europe. It was launched at the beginning of March and has a huge celebrity following. Kerry Washington, Gabrielle Union, and Elizabeth Banks are fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=desperate-housewives-residuals><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Desperate Housewives Residuals</span></h2><p>Eva Longoria played Gabrielle Solis on Desperate Housewives from 2004 until 2012..for one hundred and eighty episodes. The show was a massive hit, gathering over one hundred and eighty-two award nominations and winning three Golden Globes. The show was such a hit, Eva could choose never to work again. The show is still in reruns on television, which provides Eva with some nice residual checks.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Little Known Facts About Eva Longoria's Time On Desperate Housewives</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmsOiecuopaCnop6ubq3MmqqsnZRitaa%2BjHFnZqWZobmqu81mpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./neil-patrick-harris-success-story.html><span>←</span><span>He's Legen-dary: How Neil Patrick Harris Made His $40 Million Fortune</span></a>
