<span>Kelle Repass</span></p><h1>After This Video From Sumner Stroh, Fans Are Second-Guessing The Adam Levine Accusations</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Last summer, Influencer and Instagram Model <a href=#>Sumner Stroh came forward with allegations</a> that Maroon 5 lead vocalist Adam Levine had been cheating on his Victoria's Secret model wife Behati Prinsloo. Stroh took to TikTok to reveal Levine's infidelity saying "I was having an affair with a man who's married to a Victoria's Secret model. At the time, I was young, I was naive, and, I mean, quite frankly, I feel exploited. I wasn’t in ‘the scene’ like I am now, so I was definitely very easily manipulated. My morals were unknowingly compromised. I was completely manipulated."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a series of screenshots revealed by Sumner throughout the video, it was alleged that Adam Levine wanted to name his third child after her. The "supposed" text from Adam read, "OK serious question. I’m having another baby, and if it’s a boy I really wanna name it Sumner. You OK with that? DEAD serious." Netizens were quick to criticize Adam but Stroh was not immune from backlash either. Users made parodies with her "new to LA" excuse. Others were quick to point out that Stroh stating that he was a Victoria's Secret model's husband instead of addressing him as the "Maroon 5 singer" in itself was the biggest clue that she was chasing fame.</p><h2 id=did-sumner-stroh-make-up-the-affair-for-fame>Did Sumner Stroh Make Up The Affair For Fame?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A Reddit user posted this video from Sumner Stroh from a long back in which Stroh looked utterly different. In the TikTok video, Sumner gushes about singer and rapper Lil Nas X for being "a genius" for making a controversial music video for Call Me By Your Name.</p><p>"He knew what he was doing, he knew he was making a controversial video and that people would talk about it as a result and then of course blow it up because everyone would go to watch it and talk about it & literally argue over it," said Sumner in this video from early 2021.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> What Happened Between Adam Levine And Instagram Model Sumner Stroh?</a></span></p><p>This video has made users wonder <a href=#>if Stroh had made the affair up</a> for gaining publicity on the internet. This has been a valid concern as Netizens have been pointing out certain discrepancies from Sumner's Stroh.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The video has only ignited theories that the whole affair was faked and that she might have taken inspiration from Lil Nas X.</p><h2 id=why-did-sumner-stroh-release-the-video-in-september-2022>Why Did Sumner Stroh Release The Video In September 2022?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/adam-levine.png><p>If there is something that immediately made a lot of netizens suspicious it was the timing of the reveal of the supposed affair by Sumner Stroh. There were lots of speculation from fans that Stroh was secretly jealous of <a href=#>Behati Prinsloo, Adam's model wife</a>.</p><p>A commenter on TikTok pointed out that Stroh had used the phrase "man who's married to a Victoria's Secret model" to describe Adam Levine, a man who is famous in his own right.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Sumner Stroh Set To Make A Ton of Money After Her Adam Levine Scandal?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Others also pointed out that if Stroh was genuinely remorseful of her actions she would've privately reached out to Behati Prinsloo instead of making a TikTok for the whole world to see. Users also theorized that Stroh may have been insecure about Prinsloo's pregnancy.</p><p>Another commenter stirred the pot when they revealed that Sumner Stroh was one of the cast members of a reality dating show that was about to air. "Convenient timing wouldn't you say," remarked the user.</p><p>The show Miss/Match is about reality dating show between OnlyFans stars where they are tasked with challenges to complete together. The show was to air approximately a month after the scandal broke out.</p><p>The timing was too close for fans to not link it together and claim that Stroh wanted more attention for the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sumner-stroh-allegedly-reached-out-to-media-outlets-to-sell-the-story>Sumner Stroh Allegedly Reached Out To Media Outlets To Sell The Story</h2><p>In the original video made by Sumner Stroh, she claimed that her friend tried to sell the story to a tabloid. But Morgan Stewart and Hunter March who are both hosts on E's Nightly Pop allege that they got DMs from Sumner revealing both the affair and Behati's pregnancy to them.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Shaquille O'Neal Believes Adam Levine Is A 'Good Man' Amid Cheating Scandal</a></span></p><p>Morgan Stewart said that she thought Sumner was lying as the news of Behati's pregnancy had not been public yet and dismissed her DMs. Hunter March stated he tried to reach an agreement on an exclusive with Sumner, but the deal fell through.</p><p>Perez Hilton also came forward with receipts that Sumner tried to sell the story to him. The screenshot read, "I am a business acquaintance of Sumner Stroh of the Adam Levine story. She is fielding options of a publication that may be open to the exclusive on her story."</p><p>Perez however turned them down saying that their best bet would be a UK tabloid.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sumner-stroh-39-s-brother-39-s-ex-girlfriend-spoke-out>Sumner Stroh's Brother's Ex-Girlfriend Spoke Out</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Is-Sumner-Stroh-Set-To-Make-A-Ton-of-Money-After-Her-Adam-Levine-Scandal_-(1).jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In a now-deleted TikTok by Sumner Stroh's younger brother's ex-girlfriend Abby Neal</a>, she claimed<strong> </strong>that Sumner's video is a calculated one and that she feels no remorse about posting the affair publicly on TikTok causing hurt and public shame to Adam Levine's family.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Emily Ratajkowski's Comments About The Adam Levine Scandal Hint At Drama With Her Cheating Ex</a></span></p><p>Neal went on to reveal that Stroh is a marketing major and that she knows exactly what she's doing by exposing Adam publicly. To further claim that Sumner may have made this all up, Abby shared screenshots that are supposedly from Sumner in which she was being mean to Abby.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps the biggest proof that Stroh may have made this all up, claim fans, is the fact that Adam Levine and his wife Behati Prinsloo are still together.</p><p>In the statement he posted concerning the alleged affair, Adam denied the affair but said that he used poor judgment in speaking with anyone other than his wife in any kind of flirtatious manner. He also said, "We will get through it. And we will get through it together."</p><p>True to his word, the couple was spotted enjoying their beach day with their daughters Gio Grace and Rusty Rose after the scandal broke out. The couple welcomed their third child in January 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdqMKuusSrZKysoqS1brjInmSamp%2BqwW6tw5qkZqSVq7avsYycn56ZpJ67qHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-peek-inside-the-gigantic-empire-of-hassanal-bolkiah-sultan-of-brunei.html><span>←</span><span>A Peek Inside The Gigantic Empire Of Hassanal Bolkiah, Sultan of Brunei</span></a>
