But he has also faced some harsh criticism for some problematic comments and business decisions. Some praised him for joining the cryptocurrency market, while others scoffed at the idea. <a href=#>Some love his portrayal of a loving father on </a><a href=#>Brooklyn 99</a>, while others point out some past films and shows he did that did not age well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is Next For The 'Brooklyn 99' Cast Now That The Sitcom Is Over?</a></span></p><p>It is safe to say that the public has mixed feelings about the former NFL player, here are some of the things that make Terry Crews a complicated figure. Some of them are positive, some of them are negative, but all of them are true.</p><h2 id=terry-crews-is-a-popular-comedy-actor><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Terry Crews Is A Popular Comedy Actor</span></h2><p>Starting with one of the reasons why fans like Terry Crews, the most obvious one is the fact he has starred or been featured in several popular shows and movies. Some of his most famous roles, besides Brooklyn 99, are White Chicks, Friday After Next, The Expendables, and Everybody Hates Chris. He also can do drama, he had a 5 episode stint in Arron Sorkin's show The Newsroom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=terry-crews-supports-metoo-and-women-39-s-rights><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Terry Crews Supports MeToo And Women's Rights</span></h2><p>Many fans were glad to hear Terry Crews come out in favor of the Me Too movement and women's rights. Crews also got the support from many fans when he came forward with a MeToo story. Crews accused Agent Adam Venit of groping him at a party in 2016. Venit was never criminally charged and he still works for the William Morris Endeavor. Many survivors of sexual assault can relate to being afraid of retaliation for coming forward, as Crews said he was, and can relate to the trauma that comes from seeing your attacker continue their life without facing justice. Coming forward about the assault endeared Crews to many.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>An Update On The Careers Of The Biggest #MeToo Villains</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=but-he-39-s-said-some-problematic-things-about-sex><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>But He's Said Some Problematic Things About Sex</span></h2><p>Crews lost some of his feminist clout when he opened up about his problems with pornography. Crews claims he is a recovered porn addict and claims that his obsession with porn lasted until he got psychiatric treatment in 2010. However, the American Psychological Association <a href=#>does not consider porn addiction </a>a "true" addiction. Sex positive feminists argue that anti-porn stances perpetuate a bad understanding of feminine sexuality.</p><h2 id=terry-crews-invests-in-cryptocurrency><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Terry Crews Invests In Cryptocurrency</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Crews announced his own Etherium-based cryptocurrency $POWER in 2021. Critics of cryptocurrency like to point out that the market is rife with fraud because it is dangerously unregulated. They are also quick to point out that the market is volatile and prone to crash easily. Some also argue that people who are already rich have an unfair advantage in the market because they can easily buy already expensive pieces of crypto. Whether fans like it or not, Crews is a part of the crypto scene. Several celebrities are invested in the crypto market though, like Paris Hilton and <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>.</p><h2 id=terry-crews-promotes-a-positive-image-with-his-characters><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Terry Crews Promotes A Positive Image With His Characters</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But, his crypto investments do not deter fans from loving the characters he plays, especially his role as Terry Jeffords on Brooklyn 99. On the show, despite being a large and intimating man, Crews' character is a loving and responsible father, is intelligent, and successful in his field. In the past, black characters in Hollywood were not portrayed in such a positive light. This positive portrayal of a black man is one of the reasons many argue that Brooklyn 99<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was such a progressive show</a>.</p><h2 id=terry-crews-has-played-some-problematic-characters><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Terry Crews Has Played Some Problematic Characters</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, while his portrayal of Terry Jeffords is hailed as a step in the right direction for proper representation in Hollywood, the opposite can be said of some of his earliest characters. For example, the character he played in Ice Cube's Friday After Next was an ex-con who was obsessed with forcing himself on straight men. The bit is unapologetically homophobic, one character even uses a gay slur when referring to Crew's character. Crews has never apologized for the problematic representation.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Are Asian Activists Mad At Tina Fey?</a></span></p><h2 id=some-feel-that-terry-crews-has-a-bad-stance-on-black-lives-matter><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Some Feel That Terry Crews Has A Bad Stance On Black Lives Matter</span></h2><p>At the peak of the George Floyd Rebellion of 2020, Crews posted a tweet that many felt was nearsighted and belittling. Crews tweeted that Black Lives Matter should be all-inclusive and not turn into <a href=#>"Black Lives Better,"</a> and that he was worried about "Black supremacy" becoming as much of a problem as white supremacy. People on Twitter were quick to criticize Crews for this stance and were surprised by it, considering the fact he is responsible for bringing positive representation to the black community thanks to his role as Terry Jeffords.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=terry-crews-did-an-ad-for-amazon><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Terry Crews Did An Ad For Amazon</span></h2><p>Crews also got a lot of flack from the modern labor movement when he did an advertisement and promotional stunt for amazon. Crews posted a Tik Tok of himself working in an Amazon Warehouse to promote the company and to help recruit employees. While that does not sound that bad on the surface, Crews did so when Amazon workers in Staten Island were in the middle of unionization. Also, many criticize Amazon Warehouses for having notoriously poor working conditions, some of which go as far as ignoring workplace safety regulations. Amazon also has a lot of employee turnover in their warehouses, which labor organizers argue is due to those poor conditions. Overall, <a href=#>many felt the ad was tone deaf.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=terry-crews-is-a-talented-artist><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Terry Crews Is A Talented Artist</span></h2><p>All criticisms of Crews aside, one thing that has always endeared him to the public is his artwork. Before he joined the NFL, Terry Crews' first job was courtroom sketch artist. Also, Crews did not make much money in the NFL as he was cut from rosters and traded frequently. So to make ends meet he would paint portraits commissioned by his teammates or he would do NFL-themed lithographs. In the difficult economy facing the modern world, many can relate to needing a side hustle to survive. So, is Terry Crews a problematic actor or a relatable role model? It would seem the answer is both.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Who Were Dior's Celebrity Spokesmodels Before Johnny Depp?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirnqqirnqkvsSwqmaqlZbAsLqMsJ%2ByZZaWu7R5zKKvnpxdm7KmuMinnqxlkqG6bq3MmrGopl2isrW7zmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-troy-kotsur-daughter-kyra-monique-kotsur-meet-the-family-of-oscar-winning-actor-on-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Troy Kotsur Daughter Kyra Monique Kotsur?
