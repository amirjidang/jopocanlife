This is my home. This is comfort,” said Norwood.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Norwood said an expensive medical procedure cost him his job and his house a year ago.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Now he is making do with about 100 other people living in the county’s largest homeless encampment.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">He worries that the letter from a Gastonia city attorney will take away this home.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The letter refers to problems with trash. It said the city will ask a judge for a mandatory injunction banning camping.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“It’s just terrible, you are trying [to] kick us off this land. We have nowhere to go,” Norwood said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Besides being home for Benny, it has been a hotbed for the police. In the last three years, there have been 279 calls for service there. Most of them were this year: 163 from January to early June, including 21 property crimes and 14 overdoses.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Norwood said he works every day and stays out of trouble. He said that’s true for most people here.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“We are not bad people like you think we are. We are good, loving people,” said Norwood.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The operator of the Faith, Hope and Love Ministries said he will ask the city not to give up on the people here and his plan to turn these trailers into classrooms to educate people with few other options.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“They see them as obstacles. I see them as opportunities. They see them as liabilities. I see them as assets,” said Pastor Moses Colbert.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">A group called You Are the Power is speaking out with them.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The leader plans to address the city council.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“Their duty is to protect and defend people not to punish people who are helping others,” said Spike Cohen, Founder of You Are the Power.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Channel 9 is following the developments surrounding the encampment, and we’ll report any updates on the city’s plan to clear it.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><i><b>(WATCH: Body discovered near railroad tracks in west Gastonia, police say)</b></i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cmg-cmg-tv-10030-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/D2o0DN0rjgABuecFcGLRPiWM_uE=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/d1hfln2sfez66z.cloudfront.net/06-15-2023/t_754fcca7c86441d09248d30bfa7d8cf9_name_kl_body_found_RAW_frame_3228.jpeg"><p class="ImageMetadata__MetadataParagraph-sc-1gn0vty-0 gAFIWJ image-metadata"><span class=title>Body discovered near railroad tracks in west Gastonia, police say</span></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph body-copyright">©2023 Cox Media Group</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL%2FOnKuvZpOkunC6xLCqaKSfmK6te8%2Brpq2do6m8s7%2BMoJitoJWneqit0q2mp6GRYrCwwdGtn6ito5p6tMHPqaarrF2dvK6xy56qrGWVo7Ciuc%2BmnKesX3qAm4Gnknt6g354lYOVtoJph4d1aZV1j5WGZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-wiki-biography-height-weight-net-worth-wife-family.html><span>←</span><span>Prince Harry (Duke of Sussex) Wiki, Biography, Height, Weight, Net Worth, Wife, Family</span></a>
