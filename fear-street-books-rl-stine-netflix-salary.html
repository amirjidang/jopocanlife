Stine loves the trilogy</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From the first movie, it became clear that Shadyside isn't an easy place to live, and this town is the perfect setting.

A good gauge is 10% of the purchase price if the story rights are later bought."</p><p>While fans don't know what R.L. Stine was paid for the option for these three movies, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">R.L. Stine's net worth</a> is $200 million so he has been doing really well in his writing career.</p><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, over 400 million of R. L.

Stine On Writing His 'Fear Street' Book Series</h2><p>In an interview with The Huffington Post, R.L. Stine said that he never wanted to write a scary story that took place in New York City, which has been his home since he finished his college years.</p><p>R.L. Stine said, “It’s a superstition. I’ve never done it. A lot of kids don’t know New York. They know a nice suburban backyard, but they don’t know New York City. It’s kind of elite in some ways, I think. I think it would make the stories more obscure for kids.”</p><p>The author also said of the Fear Street books, “Of course, I always wonder why they don’t move to Happy Street."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>R.L. Stine explained that he and his publisher were thinking about him publishing a book series and he felt that having stories set on a scary street would be a great idea. He said, "And then we started thinking about location and that kind of thing, and I thought, if I can think of a good name for the series, I’ll be off to a good start.”</p><p>Fans are curious about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">R.L. Stine's writing process</a> and he shared that he doesn't like to stop writing for longer than a two-week period. He said, "A friend of mine once asked me, ‘How long can you go without writing? Writers don’t retire do they?’" He explained that he is okay with a two-week writing hiatus or a trip somewhere, and he gets "uncomfortable" when he goes too long without being able to write.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Mental Floss, R.L. Stine said that the name came easily. He said, “It was the first one I thought of: Fear And I thought, ‘That would be a place where bad things happen. It’ll be a very normal, suburban town, but there’ll be this one street that’s cursed. People who go to Fear Street or people who move to Fear Street, terrible things would happen to them. And that would be a way to do a series.’ And that’s how it started, by basing it on the location and not the characters.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Was The Biggest Challenge When Filming The '90s Classic 'Goosebumps'</a></span></p><p>R.L.
