The capital generated by Virgin's several brands, like Virgin Galactic, probably accounts for the lion's share of his wealth. His company's <a href=#>business venture capital portfolio </a>includes Twitter, Slack, Pinterest, and Square. He takes a straightforward approach to life and sees every situation as an opportunity. He usually has a positive outlook on life and knows there are always solutions to issues and methods to make things work. He started some unsuccessful businesses as a result of this.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The British billionaire has never let a setback keep him from promoting his products whenever possible.Sometimes the most incredible method to accomplish this is to demolish a competitor's goods in front of a live audience in Times Square. Still, other times, his plan is as straightforward as making an appearance in a film or television program. Following are a few of Branson's last cameos:</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Every Rumored Cameo In 'Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness'">Every Rumored Cameo In 'Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness'</a></span></p><h2 id=richard-branson-in-casino-royale><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Richard Branson in Casino Royale</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The eccentric businessman Richard Branson covered the cost of his secret cameo in the pseudo-reboot of Casino Royale in 2006. Branson, a devoted admirer of the Bond movies, appeared with his son in Daniel Craig's first outing as 007 in addition to himself. Given that one of Branson's most well-known accomplishments is the formation of Virgin Atlantic airlines, it seems appropriate that Branson portrayed the part of a passenger walking through an airport security checkpoint in the movie. As he passes through security, Branson doesn't appear to be carrying any luggage. According to rumors, the business billionaire saved the filmmakers a ton of money by not charging them for the jet in exchange for the cameo.</p><h2 id=only-fools-and-horses><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Only Fools and Horses</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From 1981 through 2003, Only Fools & Horses, a British sitcom, <a href=#>aired on BBC One</a>. The show featured Richard Branson as an airline owner and starred David Jason. In the scene, Del, played by David Jason, a dealer who could, if necessary, sell ice to an Eskimo, is seen getting on a plane to Miami. He mentions the person in front of him in line thinking he owns the jet because he is impatient and annoyed by him. Del is shocked to see Richard Branson's face when the individual finally turns.</p><h2 id=friends><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Friends</span></h2><p>A guest appearance by Richard Branson was made in Friends' fourth season. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Branson plays a street vendor</a> in the scene while Chandler, played by Matthew Perry, and Joey, played by Matt LeBlanc, look for trinkets. Joey tries on a hat with a British motif that he likes, but Chandler finds it ridiculous. Before telling Joey that Chandler is just envious and that the hat was appropriate for the weather, Branson stays quiet most of the talk. Branson deems Joey's decision to select the hat over Chandler as wise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=baywatch><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Baywatch</span></h2><p>There is a reasonable probability that one of Branson's companies will be advertised whenever he appears on a program. The<a href=#> five characters from Friends</a> were flown to London by Virgin Atlantic, and Virgin Cola, a carbonated soft drink that has since been phased out of the market, was advertised on Baywatch. To the amazement of Hobie Buchanon, played by Jeremy Jackson, and his father, who is watching, Richard receives a call from singer Gladys Knight when he is in California trying to break a record.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Mila Kunis Reveals The Most Exciting Thing About Being On ‘Baywatch’ As A Kid">Mila Kunis Reveals The Most Exciting Thing About Being On ‘Baywatch’ As A Kid</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=birds-of-a-feather><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Birds of a Feather</span></h2><p>From 1989 to 1998, the British sitcom Birds of a Feather was shown. Ironically, Dorien, who was Lesley Diana Joseph joins the mile-high club on Virgin Atlantic in the episode when Branson makes an appearance. Dorien visits the upper-class area in search of a charming, wealthy tycoon, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she happens to locate Richard Branson</a>, who she is charmed to meet. While reading a newspaper, Branson puts it down to shake Dorien's hand.</p><h2 id=london-dreams><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>London Dreams</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are other places where Richard Branson has been on television besides British and American programs. In 2009, at the height of Virgin Mobile's popularity in India, Branson appeared in the Bollywood film London Dreams. Ajay Devgn and Salman Khan are the stars of the musical drama. Both critically and commercially, the movie did not fare well. Most of the unfavorable reviews focused more on the film's plot than the cast.</p><h2 id=superman-returns><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Superman Returns</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Branson contributed to the 2006 film Superman Returns, directed by Bryan Singer. <a href=#>American actor Brandon Routh</a>, Kate Bosworth, James Marsden, and Kevin Spacey starred in the movie, the sixth and last installment in the Superman series. Richard Branson appeared in it as a shuttle engineer. The billionaire's son Sam also made a cameo appearance, so he wasn't the only one. This time, Branson's Virgin Galactic shuttle was the business of his that was able to command attention. The movie earned equally favorable and unfavorable reviews after its release.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title='Brandon Routh Says His Legends Of Tomorrow Exit Felt "Quick And Forced"'>Brandon Routh Says His Legends Of Tomorrow Exit Felt "Quick And Forced"</a></span></p><h2 id=around-the-world-in-80-days><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Around the World in 80 Days</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on the book Around the World in 80 Days that was published in 2004 and was made into a movie. Jackie Chan, Steve Coogan, and Cécile de France are the film's main actors. Branson is famous for his love of adrenaline-inducing activities; if there is one thing about him that stands out. Branson appeared in the movie as a hot air balloon pilot, and the film succeeded in doing just that. The movie earned losses and did not perform well at the box office. Additionally, it received two Stinker Award nominations and two Razzie Award nominations.</p><h2 id=derek-and-clive-get-the-horn><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Derek and Clive Get the Horn</span></h2><p>The 1979 documentary Derek and Clive Get the Horn followed <a href=#>English comedic actor Peter Cook </a>and Dudley Moore, a comedy team, working on their album of comedic songs, Derek and Clive Ad Nauseam. Branson made a few brief appearances in it, none of which were substantially tied to the plot. But that wasn't his final appearance in an unscripted program. He recreated a well-known Titanic moment with Kate Winslet for CNN in 2011. Branson is known to have starred in his own reality show in addition to making appearances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-soup><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Soup</span></h2><p>The Soup, hosted by Joel McHale, aired on E! between 2004 and 2015. Popular culture was the main topic of the program, and McHale frequently discussed the best television moments of the previous week.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Branson appeared as an intern </a>in one of the show's episodes. Despite McHale's warnings to the contrary, Branson repeatedly engaged in water battles with Stephen Colbert while playing the part. Branson was dismissed due to his tendency to not listen in any way.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=# title="The True Story Behind Kate Winslet Saving Richard Branson's Mom From A Fire">The True Story Behind Kate Winslet Saving Richard Branson's Mom From A Fire</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ2jmnqivsRmq6GdXWZ9bq7IoJ6eq6RisKK5xKiqZqeWYsCqvoyroJygkaexbq7RmqWsp55k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./inside-amphitrite-the-superyacht-of-j-k-rowling.html><span>←</span><span>The Superyacht Of J.K.
