Without a doubt, he is still a beloved figure for his role in the film and for being an all-around nice guy. However, there’s one thing fans are deeply uncomfortable about him – his relationship with Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell, and here’s why!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For those who don’t remember, the American actor passed away in a tragic car accident alongside his friend, Roger Rodas, the driver of the car. When this happened, he was on his way from a charity event while on a break from filming Fast & Furious 7 film in 2013. His death directly impacted the end of the movie which was a tribute to him, but it also sparked controversy about his complicated relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What The Cast Of 'Fast And The Furious' Actually Thought Of Paul Walker</a></span></p><h2 id=paul-walker-rsquo-s-complicated-relationship-revealed-after-his-death>Paul Walker’s Complicated Relationship Revealed After His Death</h2><p>At the time of his demise, Paul was 40 and dating Jasmine, who was 23. The 17-year age gap became an issue for the fans, noting that the two started dating when the girl was only 16 and the actor was 33. According to In Touch Weekly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the couple had been living together at the time of his death</a>, and Jasmine had been close with <a href=#>his 15-year-old daughter, Meadow Walker</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is an aspect of Paul’s life that isn’t readily discussed and is almost completely unknown to some. Many actually hadn’t heard about his relationship with Jasmine until years after his death, which for fans, was extremely troubling since Jasmine was only a minor when she started dating the actor.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Vin Diesel Recalls Being So Touched By Paul Walker Tribute In ‘F9’</a></span></p><h2 id=here-rsquo-s-what-fans-thought-about-paul-walker-rsquo-s-complicated-relationship>Here’s What Fans Thought About Paul Walker’s Complicated Relationship</h2><p>While there is no proof that Paul had a sexual relationship with Jasmine while she was underage, the romantic nature of his affair had drawn attention to many. One of the Twitter users posted, “Paul Walker’s girlfriend was a minor. Young enough to be his daughter. If it’s wrong for R. Kelly, it’s wrong for Paul Walker. What’s wrong? We’re about equality right? Dig him up and sit him in court like Michael Jackson.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another chimed in, “Isn’t it great how predators and abusers are sheltered from any consequences and go on to ruin countless lives because they provide tepid entertainment and somehow Hollywood and fans thinks it’s a fair trade?” It can be remembered that before Paul’s relationship with Jasmine, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he dated Aubrianna Atwell</a> when he was 28 and the girl was reportedly 16.</p><p>With the truth being revealed after his death, many came to social media to express their thoughts about it. One wrote via Twitter, “Walker was a part of the pedo squad. Walker’s daughter’s friend Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell began dating Paul Walker when she was just 16, Walker was 33 at the time. The couple were together until the time of his death. He stuck to Cali where the age of sexual consent is 18.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For many, it is worth asking why Paul’s relationship with teenage girls was never given attention because this is another example of people turning their eyes blind when a Hollywood star is doing something wrong. While there are many who questioned the actor’s relationship with teenage girls, his fans are glad about his <a href=#>will of leaving his fortune to his daughter, Meadow</a>.</p><p>A fan tweeted, “So glad paul walker left everything to his daughter not his girlfriend.” Another commented, “My respect to Paul Walker for leaving his money to his daughter and not his girlfriend…your kids always go first.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Who Inherited Paul Walker's Estate And Where They Are Now</a></span></p><h2 id=has-paul-walker-rsquo-s-ex-girlfriend-jasmine-pilchard-gosnell-moved-one>Has Paul Walker’s Ex-Girlfriend, Jasmine Pilchard Gosnell Moved One?</h2><p>By the time of Paul Walker’s death, he had been dating Jasmine for roughly seven years. With all their time together, the young woman then suddenly found herself single and was completely devastated by her loss. According to reports, <a href=#>she had posted about her grief on Facebook several times in mid-2014</a>. At one point she wrote, “I walk the streets of one.”</p><p>Jasmine’s father also spoke to the press about his effort to console and help her daughter. He revealed, “I have her in grief counseling. You have to understand that she is still terribly wounded by Paul’s death and will be for a long time.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Currently, Jasmine has remained silent and out of the spotlight. But one thing is clear, she has managed to move on from her loss, at least to a certain degree. She has now a musician boyfriend named Travis Turpin. It was reported that she had gotten engaged, however, whether they got married remains a mystery – just as Jasmine and Paul’s love story.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>15 Unknown Facts About Paul Walker</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYq6zsYydnJ6onK56trrCqKSfp6KprqO4xGaYm6elqXqxrdSlZLCZnKCys7%2BMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnZq%2BZqbVutsCspKKmlWK9qrjCoZirnJekwK%2Bxy6VkoZ2imsBuw8eyZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eddie-kaye-thomas-bio-age-height-parents-wife-career-and-net-worth-2.html><span>←</span><span>Eddie Kaye Thomas Bio, Age, Height, parents, WIfe, Career and Net Worth</span></a>
