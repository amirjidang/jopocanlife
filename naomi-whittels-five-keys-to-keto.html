The pro says 90 percent of people are fiber-deficient, which can lead to a weak immune system and cause the body to store extra fat. Fiber can also help you stay youthful; plus, it contains micronutrients and prebiotics that can aid in digestion. Whittel’s fiber-filled meal plan can rev up the metabolism, balance hormones, improve your skin and more.</p><p class=p1><strong>Easy Eating</strong></p><p class=p2>Whittel’s 22-day plan consists of simple, yummy recipes like chili and chicken tenders with cruciferous veggies (think Brussels sprouts, artichokes and cauliflower, which can reduce inflammation). The snacks, likefat bombs (a.k.a. peanut butter with a scoop of jelly on top) are tasty too, and some don’t even require home prep: SlimFast’s Keto Fat Bombs and Keto Meal Bars are great for on the go.&nbsp; “Their main active ingredient is inulin, which is a prebiotic and a dietary fiber,” Whittel says.</p><p class=p2><strong>Hydration Helpers</strong></p><p class=p3>Whittel emphasizes the importance of hydrating to ward off the risk of catching the “keto flu” (symptoms include headaches, fatigue and nausea). In addition to chugging H<span class=s2>2</span>O, Whittel recommends increasing your intake of water-based foods like celery and cucumber. “You’re putting what’s called ‘green gel water’ into your system,” which increases antiaging bonuses, she says. “It can detoxify the body, plump the skin and also help to balance hormones.”</p><p class=p3><strong>Simple Steps</strong></p><p class=p5>Folks who are anti-gym will really dig Whittel’s plan: “You’re going to put a pin in your exercise,” but you’re still going to “burn up to 500 calories a day.” How? “By incorporating the easiest movement,” she says. The human body already burns calories by digesting the food you eat (science!), so forgo overexertion on the treadmill and try the NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis) method instead. “It’s as simple as getting up from your desk every 30 minutes to stretch and walk around, or dancing in the morning to your favorite song.”</p><p class=p2><strong>Mistake Management</strong></p><p class=p3>Adopting a new lifestyle is challenging, so don’t fret if you fall off the wagon. “A quick jump start back into keto is MCT oil,” says the author, because it can “double your production of ketones in a few hours.” (Pro tip: Add a teaspoon of the creamy version to your coffee or smoothie.) More importantly, keep a positive outlook if you have a setback. “It’s a new day. You have a chance to totally renew!”</p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/HighFiberKeto-Book.jpg alt="Naomi Whittel High Fiber Keto Book" width=1000 height=1500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=p1>Read New York Times bestselling author Naomi Whittel’s High Fiber Keto: A 22-Day Science-Based Plan to Fix Your Metabolism, Lose Weight & Balance Your Hormones ($26.99, at <a href=#>naomiwhittel.com</a>) or text KETOFIBER to 44123 to find out more about SlimFast Keto.
