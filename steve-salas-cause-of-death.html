According to Villa, Bustillos “played a few gigs” before leaving and being eventually replaced by drummer Kenny Roman midway through 1972.</p><p>Steve Salas, a singer, bass player, and percussionist, performed with his brother in some fashion for more than a decade, most notably as the Salas Brothers.
