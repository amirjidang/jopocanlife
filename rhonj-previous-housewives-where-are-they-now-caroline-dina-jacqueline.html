There have been so many <a href=#>iconic reality television moments</a> that have come out of RHONJ that have shifted the scope of pop culture (remember the table flip?).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like all the other Real Housewives shows, there’s been <a href=#>a few women that have exited the show</a> throughout the years. So, where are all the previous housewives from RHONJ, and what are they up to today?</p><h2 id=nicole-napolitano-and-teresa-aprea-are-living-private-lives><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Nicole Napolitano And Teresa Aprea Are Living Private Lives</span></h2><p>You may be wondering: Who are Nicole Napolitano and Teresa Aprea, and why are they a part of this list? Well, Nicole and Teresa were a part of the Season 6 cast of RHONJ, which <a href=#>Andy Cohen has referred to as</a> “one season that you could maybe skip.” Nonetheless, Nicole and Teresa were a pair of twins that were brought on the show during the season prior to <a href=#>Terea’s jail time</a>. The season itself was pretty anticlimactic, except for when rumors were brought out that Teresa’s husband cheated on her with her own mother. Since being on the show, the twins have conducted <a href=#>pretty private lives</a>, unlike some of the other former housewives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amber-marchese-is-focusing-on-her-kids-and-real-estate><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Amber Marchese Is Focusing On Her Kids And Real Estate</span></h2><p>Another cast member that was <a href=#>only present</a> for Season 6 is Amber Marchese. Amber came onto the show during the bland season, and ended up having some tough times with the other women in the cast, along with her husband. Currently, Amber can be found focusing on her career as a real estate agent while sharing adorable photos of her children on social media.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>‘RHONJ’: Inside Teresa Giudice And Margaret Josephs' Intense Feud</a></span></p><h2 id=kathy-wakile-is-sharing-her-love-for-cooking><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kathy Wakile Is Sharing Her Love For Cooking</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kathy Wakile was a New Jersey housewife most known for being Teresa Giudice and Joe Gorga’s cousin. We all know how <a href=#>important family is to the cast of RHONJ</a>, but it evidently seems like Kathy has <a href=#>cut ties</a> with both the Giudice’s and Gorga’s. Alas, Kathy has continued to foster her love for cooking, and is <a href=#>currently teaching cooking classes</a> at Remington College while being a partner at her pizzeria, Pizza Love.</p><h2 id=siggy-flicker-has-moved-to-florida-and-caught-some-negative-attention><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Siggy Flicker Has Moved To Florida And Caught Some Negative Attention</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Siggy Flicker might have only been a part of the cast of RHONJ during Season 7 and 8, but she is one housewife fans will remember. After raving about her love for Florida during her seasons, it seems that Siggy has moved back and is enjoying life there now. She’s also continued her career and deep passion for touring and speaking to people. As for her attention in the press, Siggy has been caught with some negative attention after she voiced that she was a proud Trump supporter. Fans have even <a href=#>alleged that she was one of the rioters</a> that stormed the capitol building on January 6, 2021.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Will Teresa Giudice's Much-Anticipated Wedding Be Filmed For Real Housewives?</a></span></p><h2 id=dina-manzo-hosts-her-lifestyle-podcast><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Dina Manzo Hosts Her Lifestyle Podcast</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>OG New Jersey housewife Dina Manzo made her latest debut on RHONJ after she was a part of the Season 6 cast. Since being on the show, Dina has gone through a lot of changes, including <a href=#>moving to California</a>, remarrying, and going through <a href=#>some public trouble with her ex and family</a>. Nonetheless, Dina has persisted, and she continues to cultivate conversions about wellness, lifestyle, and self discovery on her own podcast. We can always count on Dina to bring refreshing vibes, and watching Dina post about her travel adventures is always a breath of fresh air.</p><h2 id=danielle-staub-is-influencing-via-her-social-platforms><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Danielle Staub Is Influencing Via Her Social Platforms</span></h2><p>Everyone knows that Danielle Staub was one of the most controversial New Jersey housewives to ever be a part of the show. As an OG housewife, viewers were shocked to see her rejoin the cast as a friend of during Seasons 8, 9, and 10, and her return to the show was definitely tumultuous. Nonetheless, she exited the show after Season 10, and even <a href=#>hosted her own podcast</a> where she’d recap the series and other spin-offs from Bravo through the year of 2021. Now, you can find her promoting different brands and showing off her cooking skills and intricate recipes on Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jacqueline-laurita-is-still-using-her-platform-to-advocate-for-autism><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jacqueline Laurita Is Still Using Her Platform To Advocate For Autism</span></h2><p>When Jacqueline Laurita was a part of RHONJ, she used her time on the show to advocate for autism after her son, Nicholas, was diagnosed. It’s clear that bringing more awareness to autism is still at the forefront of Jacqueline’s mission, whether she’s a part of the New Jersey cast or not. She can often be found participating in speaking engagements, working with companies, and using her social media to stand up for causes that she believes in.</p><p>Recently, the Alisa Ann Ruch Burn Foundation (AARBF) announced N.I.C.K. (Neurotypical/diverse Independent Communication Kit): A fire and burn safety instructional video inspired by Jacqueline. The resource <a href=#>fire safety education tool</a> was specially created for persons on the autism spectrum, with developmental/communication challenges, and pre-school aged children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>All The Explosive Real Housewives Drama That Went Down At BravoCon 2022</a></span></p><h2 id=caroline-manzo-is-focused-on-being-a-grandmother><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Caroline Manzo Is Focused On Being A Grandmother</span></h2><p>After leaving the show during Season 5, Caroline has still been pretty involved in the Bravo-sphere. She <a href=#>starred in her three-season series</a>, Manzo’d with Children, with her children Albie, Lauren and Christopher Manzo. She’s publicly spoken out about how in the past, Bravo has asked her back to join RHONJ as a friend of, something she had no interest in doing.</p><p>At BravoCon 2022, Caroline told OK! Magazine that she was <a href=#>invited back as a full-time housewife</a> for Season 13, but she declined the offer. Regarding her possibly joining the cast in the future, she mentioned that she would love to do it with <a href=#>Dolores Catania</a>, one of her longtime friends.
