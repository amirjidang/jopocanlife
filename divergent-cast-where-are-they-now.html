Like its source material, the films follow Tris Prior (<a href=#><strong>Shailene Woodley</strong></a>) after she learns that she’s “divergent” upon entering adulthood and won’t fit into just one of the dystopian society’s five factions. As she works to conceal her condition after joining the Dauntless faction, she learns of a plan in motion that would remove all divergents.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Theo James</strong></a> (Tobias “Four” Eaton), <a href=#><strong>Miles Teller</strong></a> (Peter Hayes), <a href=#><strong>Ansel Elgort</strong></a> (Caleb Prior), <a href=#><strong>Zoë Kravitz</strong></a> (Christina) and <a href=#><strong>Kate Winslet</strong></a> (Jeanine Matthews) <a href=#>are in the franchise’s star-studded cast</a>.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong></a>, who previously starred as Katniss Everdeen in the Hunger Games films, played a big part in helping to convince Woodley to appear in the Divergent franchise. The Secret Life of the American Teenager alum said she received several emails written by then-Lionsgate co-president <strong>Erik Feig</strong> on Lawrence’s behalf that encouraged her to come on board.</p><p>“‘You must do it. You will not regret it for a second. Yes, there are some hard things, but there are so many beautiful things that will come from an opportunity like this,’” Woodley recalled the Oscar winner’s messages to <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> in 2014.</p><p>In the same fashion as the Harry Potter, Twilight and Hunger Games franchises, the Divergent film series intended to split its final book into two films. After the third installment performed lower than expectations at the worldwide box office, it was reported that<a href=#> The Divergent Series: Ascendant was potentially going to be made into a TV film</a> with a possible spinoff TV series.</p><p>“Last I heard they were trying to make it into a television show. I didn’t sign up to be in a television show,” Woodley told <a href=#>Screen Rant</a> in 2016. “Out of respect to the studio and everyone involved, they may have changed their mind and may be doing something different, but I’m not necessarily interested in doing a television show.”</p><p>The Golden Globe nominee would later bluntly tell <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a> in February 2017, “No, I’m not going to be on the television show.” James and Teller also echoed similar sentiments before the project was canceled altogether.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Woodley and Teller have remained close since their starring roles in the franchise. In May 2021, the actors and their significant others vacationed together and <a href=#>hit the Kentucky Derby</a>.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to see where the Divergent cast is now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BZtrex0aCcp6xdmK60wIywn56qlWKus7GMrZ%2BesV2jvLh7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./diana-roque-ellis-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Diana Roque Ellis Net Worth</span></a>
