Featuring dark monsters, childhood fears, fractured families, and young love, Stranger Things perfectly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">encapsulated the pseudo-nostalgia</a> we all have for the 1980s with the real-life growing pains most of us experienced in the early 2000s; with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a touch of the supernatural</a> in there too, of course. Our obsession with Stranger Things reaches a fever pitch with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">every new season</a> that’s dropped into our eagerly-awaiting laps. Starring Millie Bobby Brown and Finn Wolfhard (along with a handful of other very talented actors, young and old) the chemistry between the two is totally palpable. But is it just acting? Or do they have a relationship that extends beyond the screen as well? Buckle up, readers, and prepare for spoilers. Though, if anyone isn’t caught up on Stranger Things at this point, you seriously need to reevaluate what you’ve been spending your quarantine time on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=millie-bobby-brown-is-taking-off>Millie Bobby Brown Is Taking Off...</h2><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Millie Bobby Brown Marks 'Stranger Things' Anniversary: '4 Years Ago My Whole Life Changed'</a></span></p><p>We’ve seen it before between castmates. Lili Reinhart and Cole Sprouse made big waves when the two stars of Riverdale revealed that they were in a real relationship off-screen. Unfortunately, theirs turned tumultuous after a time. They were also a little older than Millie Bobby Brown and Finn Wolfhard, making a relationship a little more tempting. What changed? Well, the dynamic started to shift. Cole Sprouse had decades to deal with the fact that he was famous. Not only that but Riverdale he approached as more of a well-versed old hand than a skyrocketing star. Lili Reinhart, on the other hand, didn’t have that background of Disney channel fame to bolster her. Riverdale was her first experience with superstardom, and she definitely took off after the first couple of seasons. That’s when the strain started (at least, from what we could tell).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why The Cast Of Riverdale Predicted Lili Reinhart And Cole Sprouse's Breakup</a></span></p><p>We bring that tangent up purely to point out the similarities between Millie Bobby Brown and Finn Wolfhard to the Lili/Cole dynamic. Wolfhard had a couple of credits to his name, but Brown is purely in the “rocket launch” category. That is, Stranger Things launched her sky-high out of nowhere in terms of popularity, while Stranger Things feels more like a big step up on the work ladder for Finn Wolfhard. So, could this mean that there are also similarities regarding the romantic tone of their relationships?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=it-s-bffs-not-bf-gf>It’s BFFs, Not BF/GF</h2><p>Nope. Finn Wolfhard is pretty stoic and solitary when it comes to anything romantic. Millie Bobby Brown has had a few romantic partners but generally isn’t the kind to brag about them. And trust us, Finllie (or Mileven, to use character names) isn’t a thing. Millie Bobby Brown has spoken up about the nature of their relationship and how they’re set to stay friends for the foreseeable future, even if their co-star has other ideas. That infamous post by juliaraskin14 lead Noah Schnapp to imply that Millie Bobby Brown and Finn Wolfhard were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">eager to jump into bed together</a>. However, that’s a myth that has been debunked by both Wolfhard and Brown.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But how do they manage to keep their romance on screen, then? It’s clear that the chemistry is there, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their platonic care for each other</a> is absolutely some of the strongest we’ve seen between two co-stars. Millie Bobby Brown explains, “it’s relatively easy, I think… It’s our job. It’s in the scripts and we feel comfortable with each other, we feel trusted, we’re in a safe environment, so it’s relatively easy. I think people hype it up to be awkward, more awkward than it is, but it’s just like your friend, so it’s chill,” which says more about the professionalism of these kids than many older professional actors out there. They don’t need to have a relationship in real life in order to convincingly portray one on the screen; a lot of problematic relationships could be solved if other actors adhered to that.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 BTS Pics From Stranger Things That Are More Adorable Than Creepy</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While we might have to wait a little longer for the next season of Stranger Things, we don’t need to wait any longer for answers about the relationship between Millie Bobby Brown and Finn Wolfhard. They’re good friends and great coworkers, but apparently, that’s all they are. Their romantic chemistry lives solely on the screen, which is a decision that makes a whole lot of sense to us. And they can keep that chemistry up because of their strong friendship. Apparently it’s easy to pretend to be in love when your friendship is built on a strong foundation of trust and safety; which, at the end of the day, is kind of all that love is. While we wouldn’t hold our breath waiting for a real-life relationship to form between these two kids, we’ll certainly hold our breath for the next season. And maybe (just maybe) we’ll get a little more Mileven out of it.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Move Over 'Stranger Things' Netflix Has A New Nostalgia Filled Pre-Teen Show 'Babysitters Club'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmLmwv8RmmKudXajBs63NoJyrZaSdtq%2Bz0maaqGWjqa6zv4ymoKWkmZp6o7vBm7BmmqKkxK95wKebZp6Zo7tuw86lnaGZopl8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heres-what-we-didnt-know-about-bryce-harpers-life-off-the-field.html><span>←</span><span>Heres What We Didnt Know About Bryce Harpers Life Off The Field</span></a>
