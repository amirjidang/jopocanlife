I have bigger boobs, I have cellulite on my thighs/butt, and my stomach sticks out rather than curves in,” the Ohio native explained. “This is still something I struggle with on a daily basis. And it doesn’t help when I’m being compared to other women.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Hustlers star</a> opened up about her own weight gain due to depression over the past few months, saying that it left her feeling “insecure.”</p><p>“But I did a recent bra and underwear scene and felt it was my obligation to be strong and show confidence in myself, looking as I do,” Reinhart admitted. “And I want other young women to see my body on tv and feel comfort in the fact that I’m not a size 0. And I’m not a perfect hourglass shape.”</p><p>The Miss Stevens actress pointed out that the industry “struggles with accurate representation” of male and female bodies, which is why she is focused on being a role model.</p><p>“I commend the women who have helped our industry take a step in the right ~and authentic~ direction,” she concluded. “(Charli Howard being my favorite role model).”</p><p>Reinhart has become an advocate for women embracing who they are and being true to themselves since stepping into the limelight with the CW series in 2017.</p><p>“I have always been a huge believer in embracing one’s uniqueness and finding ways to feel good in your own skin,” Reinhart said in a press release in October 2019 after she was announced as <a href=#>the newest face of CoverGirl cosmetics</a>. “Since I was 13, makeup has been an incredible source of confidence for me and a tool that can be used to enhance the natural beauty that exists in all of us. I am so honored to partner with CoverGirl, an iconic brand that is inclusive of anyone who finds joy in playing with makeup.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Galveston actress previously opened up about her <a href=#>longtime struggle with depression</a> and body dysmorphia via Twitter in May 2017.</p><p>“When I’m feeling depressed or sad, I remind myself how far I’ve come. And how I didn’t let my depression consume me,” she wrote at the time. “To anyone out there who feels depressed or hopeless … do not f—king give up on yourself. You’re all you’ve got. And you deserve the world.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaloZyeerOxyKefmqqkYsCpwdOsZJ2np6N6tb7OpaNmm5yWtq61zaBkq6Gmmr%2BlrcueZJunlJ6ytHnAq5xmrZ6nsqK4yKyroptf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leo-hohmann-wikipedia-heres-everything-about-the-journalist.html><span>←</span><span>Leo Hohmann Wikipedia: Heres Everything About The Journalist</span></a>
