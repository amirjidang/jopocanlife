This is why so <a href=#>many of Reeves' films have grossed over $100 million at the box office</a>.</p><p>While there have been a few missteps along the way, Reeves hit the jackpot when he was chosen to star in The Matrix. The film would go on to make over $467 million at the box office. A second and third films were ordered by the studio, and a trilogy was born. Now, with four films having been released, and Warner Bros. developing a fifth, The Matrix has officially turned into a franchise that has been very financially beneficial to Reeves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/keanu-reeves-gave-fans-a-look-into-his-relationship-with-this-sweet-but-awkward-interview-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Keanu Reeves Gave Fans A Look Into His Relationship With This Sweet But Awkward Interview">Keanu Reeves Gave Fans A Look Into His Relationship With This Sweet But Awkward Interview</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Keanu Reeves doesn't often share, but in one awkward interview, he revealed a sweet detail about his girlfriend, Alexandra Grant.</p><p>Reeves has been known to donate quite a bit to charities over the years. Rumors swirled that Reeves donated a huge chunk of what he made from The Matrix to those in need. However, despite Keanu Reeves making a wild amount of money from The Matrix, he did not give it all away. In fact, a majority of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reeves' $380 million net worth</a> is attributed to his salary from The Matrix.</p><h2 id=keanu-reeves-made-over-150-million-from-the-matrix-franchise>Keanu Reeves Made Over $150 Million From The Matrix Franchise</h2><h3 id=keanu-reeves-39-payday-from-the-matrix-is-the-largest-salary-any-actor-has-ever-received-from-a-franchise>Keanu Reeves' payday from The Matrix is the largest salary any actor has ever received from a franchise</h3><p>Reeves had been in dozens of films before he was cast as Neo in The Matrix. While he had made a decent amount of money from his work on the big screen and was a household name, Reeves' film history was mixed with movies that did not perform as well as they should have, as well as several box office successes.</p><p><a href=#>Reeves also turned down films he knew would flop, despite huge paydays</a>. Reeves was making between $2 million and $8 million per film, which slowly built his nest egg but didn't make Reeves worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/keanu-reeves-holding-his-hands-up-like-his-surrendering.jpg><p>When Reeves was cast in The Matrix, there was no telling that the film would be a success. Reeves was paid one of his highest paydays to date, $10 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. But sensing that the film would be a success, Reeves negotiated for 10% backend pay, a move that proved to be incredibly smart, as the film grossed $467.2 million at the box office.</p><p>Warner Bros. wanted to strike while the iron was hot and immediately ordered two more Matrix films. Reeves' payday, according to Celebrity Net Worth went up to $15 million for each film. His backend points did as well, as Reeves would receive 15% of the gross of the films. A relatively similar base salary was paid to Reeves for The Matrix Resurrections. However, it has not been reported what percentage of backend points Reeves received.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a result of taking a smaller base pay and negotiating for points, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reeves would make $154 million for his role as Neo</a>. This is the largest amount any actor has received for a franchise film series.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:00</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/keanu-reeves-relationship-with-girlfriend-alexandra-grant-drastically-changed-her-net-worth-front-back-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Here’s The Real Reason Fans Rarely See Keanu Reeves And His Girlfriend Alexandra Grant Together">Here’s The Real Reason Fans Rarely See Keanu Reeves And His Girlfriend Alexandra Grant Together</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>While Keanu Reeves and his girlfriend Alexandra Grant have a compelling relationship, they aren't seen much in public together...</p><p>Shortly after the huge financial figure was reported on, rumors began to swirl that Reeves, ever the philanthropist, donated half of his Matrix salary to charity, something that his publicist had to address to keep the rumors from getting further out of control.</p><h2 id=keanu-reeves-regularly-donates-to-charity-but-did-not-donate-his-salary-from-the-matrix>Keanu Reeves Regularly Donates To Charity But Did Not Donate His Salary From The Matrix</h2><h3 id=keanu-reeves-did-not-donate-70-of-his-salary-but-he-had-given-millions-to-charities-over-the-years>Keanu Reeves did not donate 70% of his salary but he had given millions to charities over the years</h3><p>Money is not something that Reeves focuses on when he is making a film. It is something that he is actually embarrassed by. Because of this, Reeves has given away a good amount of money to charities over the years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/keanu-reeves-laughing.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2022, it was reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reeves donated 70% of his payday from The Matrix franchise</a>. This left publications singing Reeves' praises from the rooftops. The story that was circulating was that Reeves donated the money to cancer charities because one of his sisters, Kim, was diagnosed with leukemia in 1991. However, as Reeves' publicist would later clarify, Reeves did not donate that large sum of money to charity.</p><p>"The story is not true," Reeves' publicist explained. "Keanu Reeves did not donate 70 percent of his salary to charity."</p><p>Despite the story not being true, Reeves has donated quite a bit to charities over the years. He has even given huge bonuses to those Reeves has worked with on his films. Some of the ways that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reeves has donated his money over the years</a> include:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li>Running a private foundation that donates to cancer charities</li><li>SCORE (Spinal Cord Opportunities for Rehabilitation Endowment)</li><li>Gave money back to The Matrix franchise to make special effects top-notch</li><li>Took pay cuts to star with Al Pacino and Gene Hackman</li><li>Gifted the stunt crew from The Matrix franchise Harley-Davidson motorcycles</li><li>Sponsored a motorcycle rider through his company, Arch Motorcycles</li><li>Gifting stunt people from John Wick, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">s</a><a href=#>tunt people whom Reeves knows by name</a>, Rolex watches</li></ul><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/your-paragraph-text-2024-02-21t185708-865.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Fans Were Heartbroken For Keanu Reeves After He Was Forced To Lash Out On A Fan For Breaching His Privacy ">Fans Were Heartbroken For Keanu Reeves After He Was Forced To Lash Out On A Fan For Breaching His Privacy</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Keanu Reeves finally lost it and fans completely understood why.</p><p>Reeves may feel embarrassed by the massive wealth that he has, he is going to have to be accustomed to having it spoken about. That is because The Matrix franchise was released on <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a> in April 2024.</p><h2 id=how-much-keanu-reeves-stands-to-make-from-the-matrix-franchise-being-released-on-netflix>How Much Keanu Reeves Stands To Make From The Matrix Franchise Being Released On Netflix</h2><h3 id=keanu-reeves-may-receive-bonuses-from-the-matrix-franchise-streaming-on-netflix>Keanu Reeves may receive bonuses from The Matrix franchise streaming on Netflix</h3><p>It is unclear if any of the backend deals that Reeves made for his Matrix films will be beneficial for him with the franchise being released on Netflix. While SAG-AFTRA were able to negotiate for actors who had their work put on the streaming platforms to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">receive bonuses after a certain number of streaming hours by viewers</a>, it is unclear if films from years ago fall into this category.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/instar53428661-1.jpg><p>If Reeves does receive the standard bonus from the Netflix streams, which is determined by the "total number of streaming hours" over the course of 90 days "divided by the total run time." If that equation comes out to be "0.2'" domestic views, then a bonus is paid.</p><p>While Reeves does not need the money, nor will he likely ever comment on whether he received a bonus from The Matrix franchise streaming, if a bonus is paid it would be substantial for Reeves. As such, like the rest of Reeves' fortune, it would not be surprising if some were given back to those in need, given how generous Reeves has been over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoLKiutRmnqKulWKuuK3YZqSarKKexW65zqecsmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justin-theroux-makes-rare-comment-about-jennifer-aniston-split.html><span>←</span><span>Justin Theroux Makes Rare Comment About Jennifer Aniston Split</span></a>
