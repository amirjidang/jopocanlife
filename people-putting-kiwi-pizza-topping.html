Even things most would imagine are universally loved are disliked by some. Not everyone loves ice cream as much as you do, and as hard as it is to believe, there are people out there, somewhere, that do not enjoy eating chocolate.</p><p>Some culinary arguments have left society split right down the middle. However, there is no food argument more controversial than the one over whether pineapple belongs on pizza. It's a fruit, and a sweet one at that, so it makes sense that it wouldn't belong atop a savory circle of tomato and cheese. However, when paired with ham and slapped with a Hawaiian tag, some people think it is positively delicious.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Papa John's Founder Needed To Eat 40 Pizzas In 30 Days To Come To This Conclusion</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We would like to pick up the pineapple on pizza argument and place it neatly to one side for a moment if that's okay. That's because someone has slapped another fruit on top of their pizza and we are definitely not okay with it. Someone on Twitter posted a photo of a pizza with kiwi fruit as a topping, a culinary mash-up discovered in Denmark according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hook</a>.</p><p>The internet has been reacting to kiwi on pizza in the exact way you might expect, with disgust for the most part. One person reacted by requesting the pizza be killed with fire, while another claimed to have warned everyone all along that pineapple was nothing more than a gateway topping. If that is indeed the case, we dread to think what someone will be popping on top of a pizza next.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not every reaction to kiwi on pizza has been a negative one. Some seem to quite like the idea. Honestly, if you're a fan of pineapple on pizza and don't mind kiwi, we'd have thought you would at least give it a try. Plus, when it comes to anything in the food world, as long as people aren't trying to make us eat it, or look at it in some cases, then each to their own, even if it is something as weird as kiwi on pizza.</p><p><strong>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Family Cleans House & Finds Tortoise They Lost In 1982 Alive & Well</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmraCZo7S0e8%2BepqmklWK9tsDToqWgZZuexKp5z6Kxs5ldqbyxvMinnmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pat-tillman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-112151-html.html><span>←</span><span>Pat Tillman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
