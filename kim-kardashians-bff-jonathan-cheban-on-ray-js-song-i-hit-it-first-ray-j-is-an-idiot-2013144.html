But luckily for her, aside from her immediately family, Kardashian has several staunch supporters in her corner — including BFF <strong>Jonathan Cheban</strong>.</p><p>The Kourtney and Kim Take Miami regular recently told <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> that he takes the public digs at his bestie personally, especially the most recent one, from Kardashian's ex <strong><a href=#>Ray J</a></strong>.</p><p>"When I saw that idiot Ray J make a song about her, you know I held myself back from twittering that Ray J is a real retard," he told <strong>Us</strong> at the Blacks annual gala in Miami on Saturday, April 13. "But you know, I can't deal with a thousand people twittering back and forth so I let it go. I mean, who does that?! You're a loser and you'll always be a loser."</p><p>The song in question is a single that Ray J released earlier this month, "I Hit It First," reportedly a diss at both his ex and her current beau, Kanye West.&nbsp;</p><p>"She might move on to rappers and ballplayers/ But we all know I hit it first," he raps on the track. "I had her head going North and her ass going South/ But now baby chose to go West."</p><p>The "Sexy Can I" singer later took to Twitter to deny that the song had anything to do with his famous ex, however, telling fans to "have some fun! It's not that serious!"</p><p>In an interview with New York radio station Hot 97, the rapper added that all the buzz over the song was misplaced, because he'd written it "about a concept."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"People going way too deep," he said on Monday, April 8. "They just gotta keep it on the surface. I'm not trying to create no war, it's all love; we're doing music."</p><p>Cheban also slammed the constant criticism Kardashian has had to navigate around during her pregnancy, saying that the cruel comments no longer get under his skin — or Kardashian's.</p><p>"You know, it's annoying we all get a lot of negative comments on Instagram, Twitter and stuff, but you know what? We're working hard and enjoying life," he told <strong>Us</strong>. "And it doesn't really affect us. You know there's a lot of haters out there that are jealous. We know how hard we work. We don't pay attention to it. If you did you'd lose your mind."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoZ1iuKK%2Bw5qqoaGRo8BursWfZKOnnpbBqa3NZpqhnZKWu267zWapmrFdn8Buv86nnmahXZ22tXnIrWSfoaKowW6%2BwLJko2WZqHqiuoyim6KnpGJ%2FcX2SamttZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./keke-palmer-key-tv-digital-series-heaux-tell-1234708536.html><span>←</span><span>Keke Palmer Premieres KeyTVs Debut Series, Heaux &amp;amp; Tell'</span></a>
