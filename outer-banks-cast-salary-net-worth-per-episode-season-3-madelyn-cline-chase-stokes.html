The area is known for its beautiful beaches, lush vegetation, and mild climate. It's no wonder that the <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong> show <strong><a href=#>Outer Banks</a></strong>, which is set on these islands, has been so popular since it was released in April 2020. Viewers are drawn to the show for its thrilling plot, which follows a group of teens who get wrapped up in a treasure hunt. The characters are relatable and the setting is stunning. It's no surprise that Outer Banks is one of the top 10 most-watched shows on Netflix.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="The Bizarre Reason Fans Think Debby Ryan And Outer Banks’ Star Chase Stokes Are The Same Person">The Bizarre Reason Fans Think Debby Ryan And Outer Banks’ Star Chase Stokes Are The Same Person</a></span></p><p>Being that the cast of the show is made up of relatively new actors, they aren’t worth as much per episode right off the bat. When the show grows in popularity and is in higher demand, the actors start getting paid a little more to keep them around. The <a href=#>cast of Stranger Things</a> is a great example of this, they went from may-day to payday in four short seasons. However, if you’re thinking the Outer Banks cast is similar in comparison, you should probably think again; there is quite a big difference. Below we have what the main cast (<a href=#>minus the three new members</a>) makes per episode, and we think you’ll be as surprised as we were.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-madelyn-cline-of-outer-banks-make-per-episode><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>How Much Does Madelyn Cline Of Outer Banks Make Per Episode?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Outer-Banks.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the first season of Outer Banks, breakout star Madelyn Cline plays the role of Sarah Cameron, one of the main characters in the show. Cline's salary for the first season is rumored to be around $30,000 per episode, which puts her total earnings for the 10-episode season at approximately $300,000. This makes Cline one of the highest-paid actors on the show.</p><p>Cline got a raise for the second season of Outer Banks, which is really what got fans hooked on this teen drama, and it has been said that her salary increased to $40,000 per episode for the second season. This would put her total earnings for the season at $400,000.</p><p>As for her third season, Madelyn Cline had stepped it up big time. She is currently one the biggest up-and-coming stars in Hollywood and even took a role in another Netflix series, Glass Onion : A Knives Out Mystery, in between seasons of Outer Banks. She reportedly made upwards of $80,000 per episode in season three. That would give her a $800,000 payday, which tracks <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with her said net worth.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-does-chase-stokes-of-outer-banks-make-per-episode><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>How Much Does Chase Stokes Of Outer Banks Make Per Episode?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sarah-cameron-johnb-outer-banks.jpg><p>Chase Stokes, who <a href=#>originally turned down the role</a>, plays John B on Netflix's Outer Banks.It is rumored that Stokes was originally the highest-paid actor on the show. Making $40,000 per episode when they first got started. He made around $800,000 for the third season, though, making him even with Madelyn Cline.</p><p>While $800,000 per season may seem like a lot of money, it is important to remember what these actors have bills to pay and a lot of people who work for them doing various behind-the-scenes things. Still, a major step up from a guy <a href=#>who was living in his </a>car when he tried out for the role. Netflix originally planned to go four to five seasons with Outer Banks, so it’s highly likely we will be seeing it renewed for season four. This means that Stokes' salary will likely increase in the near future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-does-rudy-pankow-of-outer-banks-make-per-episode><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>How Much Does Rudy Pankow Of Outer Banks Make Per Episode?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/poguelandia-obx3-outer-banks.jpg><p>Rudy Pankow had appeared in a few short films and in some random episodes of TV shows prior to landing the role of JJ on Outer Banks.
