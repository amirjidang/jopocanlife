So, give us another year.”</p><p>Lawson added that she and Olubeko, 31, are “just trying to enjoy” the early days of their engagement “but also not wait too long.”</p><p><a href=#>The couple got engaged</a> during the season finale of <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a>, which aired on August 21. “There’s no words, and I’ve told this to her — love is not enough of a word to describe how I feel about her. She’s everything to me. She [has] only become more of everything since filming ended,” Olubeko gushed during After the Final Rose. “I’ve never been more certain about anything in my life. I want to keep rocking and keep moving.”</p><p>Lawson, for her part, said at the time that she and her fiancé want to wed “<a href=#>sooner rather than later</a>” but plan to take their time. “We’re just enjoying the season of life,” she added.</p><p>While Lawson’s schedule is pretty packed thanks to DWTS, she told Us on Tuesday that she and Olubeko still make time for date nights. “We went on a date last Thursday and we went to a comedy club,” she said. “He loves comedy. And when I say I had the best time, I was laughing my ass off. Sorry, but it was so good!”</p><p>The twosome are also watching <a href=#>The Golden Bachelor</a> and <a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a>, both of which premiered last week. Lawson added that “of course” she knows whether any of her friends in Paradise found love, but she “can’t say” just yet.</p><p>In the meantime, Lawson is thriving on DWTS, where she and partner <a href=#><strong>Artem Chigvintsev</strong></a> earned the highest score of the evening on the season premiere. (During the Tuesday episode, <a href=#><strong>Ezra Sosa</strong></a> subbed in after Chigvintsev, 41, <a href=#>tested positive for COVID-19</a>.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The rigorous schedule of DWTS has tested <a href=#>Bachelor Nation</a> romances in the past, but Lawson told Us in August that <a href=#>she and Olubeko aren’t worried</a>. ​​“We both talked about it and it’s something that I didn’t really know was going to truly happen, but he, obviously, is so supportive of it, which I admire,” she explained. ” And he’s my biggest fan, which is great to have. So, he will be here with me in L.A. as we take on this — we’ll be doing it together. He just won’t be the one dancing. I’ll be up there, [but] he’ll be along.”</p><p>With reporting by Hannah Kahn</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2XrqS0xKWmq52kqbK0ecKhmKuhpK56ra3WrKanZZmoerG4wKeloqaXYq5ufo9rbGavlZmxqrrGaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-admitted-she-regrets-putting-this-one-ex-on-blast-during-her-interview-with-ellen.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift Admitted She Regrets Putting This One Ex On Blast During Her Interview With Ellen</span></a>
