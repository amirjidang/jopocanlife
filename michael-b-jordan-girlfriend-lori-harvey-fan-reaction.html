On top of that, many <a href=#>classic romantic comedies are so good</a> that people watch them over and over again. While it is wonderful that people have gotten so much enjoyment out of movies like that, they do have one negative consequence, they give some people unrealistic expectations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on the popularity of romantic comedies, some people think that romantic relationships should be easy. In reality, however, a lot of couples who are great together have to overcome a lot of obstacles to their relationship and that holds true when it comes to celebrity pairings as well. For example, some <a href=#>celebrity couples have to deal with fans telling them to tone the PDA</a>. On top of that, <a href=#>Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> star Michael B. Jordan and his girlfriend have to cope with the fact that some of his fans are really angry at her.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Most Popular Rom Coms From The Past 30 Years, Officially Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=michael-b-jordan-rsquo-s-love-life>Michael B. Jordan’s Love Life</h2><p>Ever since Michael B. Jordan first rose to fame, there has been a perception that when compared to his Hollywood peers, he is a pretty private guy. Considering that a fair amount is known about Jordan’s love life over the years, however, that may not be the case. Instead, people may feel that way largely because he has avoided the kind of controversies that land most stars in the tabloid headlines.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael B. Jordan’s love life</a>, one of his earliest known relationships was with Australian rapper Iggy Azalea. After that relationship ended, Jordan dated Catherine Paiz from 2013 until 2014. Since 2017, Jordan has dated Saweetie, Ashlyn Castro, Kiki Layne, and Lori Harvey. It is also worth noting that there have been rumors of Jordan getting involved with other female stars but none of those pairings have been confirmed by anyone involved.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Cast Of 'Black Panther' Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=the-star-fans-wanted-michael-b-jordan-fans-want-him-to-date>The Star Fans Wanted Michael B. Jordan Fans Want Him To Date</h2><p>When Black Panther was released in 2018, moviegoers all over the world flocked to theaters to see the blockbuster film. Thankfully for everyone involved in the movie’s production, Marvel fans, and filmgoers everywhere, Black Panther turned out to be an almost universally acclaimed film that made a fortune at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, there are several reasons why Black Panther was so successful including the popularity of the MCU, the movie’s amazing special effects, and its fantastic soundtrack. Despite all of that, it could easily be argued that the best part of Black Panther was its extremely talented cast. After all, everyone who starred in Black Panther was perfect for their role. As it turns out, however, many Black Panther fans wanted to see a couple of the film’s stars have a very different relationship in real life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Black Panther fans will no doubt remember, Michael B. Jordan and Lupita Nyong'o’s characters in the film were enemies who wanted to completely defeat each other. When the two actors have appeared in public together, however, they are absolutely adorable together. For example, when the world saw footage of Nyong'o making Jordan do push-ups in public after beating him in a bet, it was hard to not be charmed by their playful relationship. For that reason, many of Nyong'o and Jordan’s fans badly wanted the two actors to become a couple in public.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Wakanda Forever: 15 Adorable Moments When The ‘Black Panther’ Cast Was Too Good For This World</a></span></p><h2 id=why-fans-are-angry-about-michael-b-jordan-rsquo-s-girlfriend-lori-harvey>Why Fans Are Angry About Michael B. Jordan’s Girlfriend, Lori Harvey</h2><p>Since 2020, Michael B. Jordan has been dating a model named Lori Harvey. For fans wanting to get a closer look at the couple’s life together, he provided a tiny window into their lives when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jordan celebrated his first anniversary with Harvey by posting affectionate photos on Instagram</a>. Aside from that post, however, a cursory look at Jordan’s Instagram account proves that he certainly isn’t making everything about his relationship the way some stars do. Despite that, a surprising amount of Jordan’s fans are mad at Harvey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When looking at the history of Michael B. Jordan and Lori Harvey’s relationship, it quickly becomes clear that she hasn’t done anything to earn the ire of his fans. Instead, there is one minor and one major reason why so many of Jordan’s fans are angry at Harvey. First off, the lesser reason is that since so many people wanted to see Micahel B. Jordan and Lupita Nyong'o become a couple, they are disappointed that didn’t happen and are taking that out on Harvey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the end of the day, it is pretty clear that the main reason why many Michael B. Jordan fans are mad at his girlfriend Lori Harvey is they are jealous of her. After all, Jordan is such a good-looking person that he was once named the Sexiest Man Alive by People magazine. On top of that, based on how Jordan handles himself during interviews and when he is in public, he seems like a really great guy. Given all of that, it makes sense that many of his fans would love to be the person dating Jordan.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The 10 Most Eligible A-Listers Under 30</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikopuYlrKtecFmoaiqlJa7brPIq6Ofqpmau6V5y6ipomWYlr%2B3sdhmnZqmXaeyoq%2FToqanZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./elon-musk-sued-for-not-paying-rent-at-twitter-headquarters.html><span>←</span><span>Elon Musk Sued For Not Paying Rent At Twitter Headquarters</span></a>
