<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>HBO Spends A Fortune On Bill Maher For His Acclaimed Political Show, Here's How Much He Makes</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>After Bill Maher launched his career as a comedian, he gained enough notoriety to get the chance to host Politically Incorrect. A show that was surprisingly successful, Politically Incorrect made Maher a major celebrity who could impact the modern political landscape. Throughout Maher's career, he has never been afraid to be controversial including the fact that he recently <a href=#>called out two massive movie stars</a>. Even though <a href=#>people often suggest Maher is about to get canceled</a>, something Maher said in 2002 really did get his show Politically Incorrect taken off the air.Once Politically Incorrect was unceremoniously canceled, that easily could have marked the end of Maher's tenure as a talk show host. Thankfully for the comedian, HBO took a chance on him when they launched Real Time with Bill Maher in 2003.Now that Maher has been hosting his show for nearly two decades, it makes sense that he gets paid a good amount of money for the show. However, even with that in mind, it is staggering to know how much the comedian's Real Time with Bill Maher salary is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-does-hbo-pay-bill-maher>How Much Does HBO Pay Bill Maher?</h2><p>In January 2023, the 21st season of Real Time with Bill Maher premiered, and new episodes will air weekly throughout most of the year. Considering that HBO is a highly successful network, it is impressive that a weekly time slot has been trusted to Maher for roughly two decades.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>All The Women Bill Maher Has Been Linked To</a></span></p><p>Just as it is impressive that HBO has employed Maher for so long, it also is remarkable that he hasn't looked for greener pastures. After all, lots of celebrities jump from one job to another, so they can maximize their earnings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bill-maher-looking-smug.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once you learn how much Maher gets paid for Real Time with Bill Maher, it makes a lot more sense that he has never tried to move on to a different show. According to Yahoo, Maher's salary for Real Time with Bill Maher is $10 million annually.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bill Maher Will Likely Never Ever Get Married, Here's Why</a></span></p><p>Since <a href=#>other talk show hosts get paid more</a>, some people may have expected Maher to have a bigger salary.</p><p>The thing to keep in mind is that while Stephen Colbert is higher paid than Maher, their jobs are different in a key way. When The Late Show with Stephen Colbert is being produced, the show airs new episodes five days a week. On the other hand, Real Time with Bill Maher is a weekly show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bill-maher-smiling.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to IMDb, seasons of Real Time with Bill Maher typically consist of 35 episodes. Keeping that in mind and reports that Maher gets paid $10 million a year, that means that Bill gets paid more than $285,000 for each episode of his talk show that he hosts.</p><h2 id=how-else-does-bill-maher-make-money>How Else Does Bill Maher Make Money?</h2><p>According to celebritynetworth.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Maher has a $140 million fortune as of this writing</a>. If Maher never spent his $10 million salary from his talk show, he could have accumulated that kind of money. However, it is no secret that Maher leads a pretty lavish lifestyle.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Bill Maher Spends His $140 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Still, it makes perfect sense that Maher has become so wealthy. After all, anyone who follows Maher's career will realize that he has created several different revenue streams for himself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bill-maher.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of the ways that Maher makes money, the longest-lasting one by far is performing standup comedy. Still performing for audiences regularly to this day, as of this writing Maher has announced shows coming up in multiple different states in the next two months alone. Since tickets to those shows aren't cheap, Maher must make a lot of money.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bill-maher-performing.jpg><p>When Maher isn't busy touring or hosting his talk show, he has also found another way to make money by launching a podcast. Titled Club Random with Bill Maher, the comedian's podcast has allowed him to interview many notable names in a long-form manner.</p><p>Another way that Maher made a lot of money proves how successful he has become.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a result of Maher's impressive wealth, he was able to buy a minority share of the New York Mets in 2012 for around $20 million. Like all investments of that size, Maher was taking a huge risk when he purchased part of the MLB team.</p><p>Fortunately for Maher, his investment paid off massively for him. In 2020, a billionaire hedge fund manager named Steve Cohen bought the New York Mets for $2.4 billion.</p><p>As a minority owner at the time, Maher's share of the Mets was included in Cohen's purchase. According to celebritynetworth.com, that meant that Maher would have been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">paid roughly $80 million for his share</a> of the team which is a huge profit for the comedian.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGwsdJmmaKknGK6orTEq2SmmZuaerOxwKVkraGdmnqprs5mqpqkkafGcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./george-wendt-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>George Wendt Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
