She has also been open about her changing friendships.</p><p>Margaret Josephs shared she and Danielle are done being friends. As Margaret told Us Weekly, "Never. That ship has sailed and sunk."</p><p>In an interview with Life & Style Magazine, Margaret said the same thing. She told the publication,</p><p>“You know, rarely do I ever have regrets. I do regret pouring the water on her." Margaret also said,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“In all seriousness, I probably shouldn’t have done that but everything else, I’m fine. I apologize if I do something wrong and mean it!”</p><p>Fans remember the wild moment that happened near the end of season 10 of The Real Housewives Of New Jersey. When everyone was shopping, Danielle pulled Margaret's hair. Fans learned that Teresa had told Danielle to do that, but no one could blame Margaret for wondering why Danielle did it.</p><p>At a party, Melissa said that she heard that Teresa told Danielle to pull Margaret's hair. At first, Margaret said she didn't think that was true, and Teresa said, "I was drinking and everything happened so fast." Margaret said, "I'm a little freaked out, I'm not gonna lie."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before the season 9 premiere of RHONJ, Margaret talked about how fans would see her friendship with Danielle change in those episodes. The reality star explained, “I mean we live in the same town, so Starbucks is the central location, and we haven’t had any deep discussion … there hasn’t really been much conversation. But I really, in all honesty, I wish her only good things and I don’t want any ill for anybody, I don’t want anybody’s life to unravel.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Fans Think 'RHONJ' Star Teresa Giudice Is Getting Engaged</a></span></p><h2 id=danielle-39-s-wedding>Danielle's Wedding</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Weddings are stressful and while it's an honor to be a bridesmaid and stand with a friend on their big day, it can lead to drama and overwhelm.</p><p>It turns out that when Danielle and Marty got married, Margaret says that affected their friendship. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Margaret talked about Danielle's behavior</a> around her wedding and said, "If it was her first wedding and she was 25, I could have understood it, but I was like, girl. You're all bougie and stuff, hire a wedding coordinator and let them do everything. She expected a lot from us to do things. At that age, who wants all that nonsense? But she wanted the big hoopla, the everything, and she got it," according to Bravotv.com. Margaret also called Danielle "demanding" and "tough." Fans could tell that this was a tough spot for Margaret to be in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans will remember the season 9 episode "Bridezilla of Bimini" when Margaret was definitely having a hard time with her friend's diva-like behavior.
