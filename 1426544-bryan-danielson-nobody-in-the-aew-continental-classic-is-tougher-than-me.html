In a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">post on Twitter</a>, AEW shared a video in which Bryan Danielson discussed his victory.</p><p>“Here we are, less three minutes after I just beat Eddie Kingston,” he said. “My heart rate’s already slowed down, and I’m here meditating. I didn’t expect you guys to come in here and film me, but I’m glad you did. Because this is a teachable moment. There’s a difference between me and Eddie Kingston. Eddie Kingston physically is tough as nails. You see it every time. He pours his whole heart every time he wrestles. But where he’s not tough is mentally.</p><p>“You see, you have to be both in this world because bad things are going to happen. In a tournament like the Continental Classic, bad things are going to happen. I fractured my orbital bone in two places. My vision is still blurry. I broke my arm in June, and I still don’t have full strength in my arm. If you’re not tough mentally, you are going to make every excuse for losing. Last week, Eddie Kingston said, ‘Humble in victory, humble in defeat.’ That’s just setting yourself up for defeat.”</p><h2 id=h-bryan-danielson-i-will-not-be-defeated>Bryan Danielson: I Will Not Be Defeated</h2><p>Bryan Danielson continued by stating that he will not be defeated, as this is his last full-time year in wrestling. He shared his belief that nobody in the AEW Continental Classic is tougher than he is.</p><p>“I will not be defeated. This is my last full-time year in pro wrestling. I come back, and I meditate after these matches so I can seal in every single thing that I feel out there. The one sport that I love more than anything else besides my family. The joy in victory, the pain of getting hit. All of it comes in, and all of it is sealed. There is not a man in the Continental. Classic, not my foes like Eddie Kingston, not my friends, like Jon Moxley and Claudio Castagnoli. There is not a man in the Continental Classic that’s tougher mentally or tougher physically than me.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>WrestleZone will have coverage of the AEW Continental Classic as it continues.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNrbW5sZGKvs8XAp2SdmZ6esq2%2Fzqdkp6eSpLG6ecinZK2glWKupsOMnKanrJmjsq%2FAwKVknKSRqMCqr4yiqmasn6q0qbHRZquhmZ5iuqY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./networth.html><span>←</span><span>Boxer Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
