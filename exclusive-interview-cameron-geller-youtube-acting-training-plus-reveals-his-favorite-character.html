I loved the way the show was shot, as a mocumentary, and how they were able to produce something so excellent on such a low budget."</p><p>Given that audiences across the globe seem much as enamored of the show, it was only a matter of time before social media users caught sight of Cameron's content ... and that's where his rise and rise really began.</p><p><strong>"When I posted it, it performed well, and I knew I could use the character again, shortly," </strong>he smiles.</p><p>That's not all - the audience response even led to the creation of another character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Soon after I'd posted, someone in the comments called me a 'Pick me.' That inspired my second character, 'Timothy Bichboy / Professional Pick Me.' Just like that, I realized this could turn into an entire cinematic universe."</p><h2 id=cameron-reveals-what-made-content-creation-so-appealing>Cameron Reveals What Made Content Creation So Appealing</h2><p>Given his revelation that he'd been involved in acting since his teen years, we couldn't help ask why he ended up changing lanes and heading for YouTube, instead.</p><p>"I graduated from a professional theater program back in 2016, and my plan was to be an actor, but after a few years of trying both acting and stand-up comedy, I grew frustrated with the process."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cameron adds that he felt he didn't have any control over his future.</p><p>"I didn't appreciate the fact that I wasn't in the driver's sear of my own career progress, but was instead at the whims of the industry."</p><p>Luckily for Cameron, he found the perfect compromise: total control of his craft, all while continuing to reach a wider audience.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>YouTube Stars Who Have Made It To The Big Screen</a></span></p><p>That would be, <strong>YouTube</strong>.</p><p>"I started to notice comedic Facebook videos, and thought to myself, 'Well, I could do that!' So, I took what I learned from my acting and comedy background, and did my best to convert it into a short video style."</p><p>With nearly half a million subscribers to his YouTube channel alone just under two years later, we'd say he's done a pretty good job at that!</p><p>What's more, he beams that the autonomy he has over his content never gets old.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The fact that I'm able to be the director, writer, and performer, <strong>and</strong> am truly able to actualize my own vision is the best part for me. I never had this much freedom as an actor - and I actually think that's one reason why so many actors turn to directing and producing their own content once they establish a name for themselves."</p><h2 id=cameron-names-his-favorite-character>Cameron Names His Favorite Character</h2><p>So, scores of fans, a dream career and a number of characters to his name ... naturally, we had to pry to see if he would name a favorite!</p><p>Luckily for us, Cameron laughs that even though it is a little akin to picking a favorite kid, he'd have to go with Chase Wood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Exclusive: Mia Dio Reveals How She Became The Internet's Favorite Satirical Sugarbaby Lifestyle Coach</a></span></p><p>"He's my most developed character, with all of his crossovers and even a backstory ... it just gives him depth and nuance, and that makes him more fun to play."</p><p><strong>"I also have to give him credit, because he did a lot for my channel,"</strong> he smiles.</p><p>"He's probably my most viewed character overall, and has really helped me grow my audience."</p><p>That said, he does have a few other honorable mentions to throw out.</p><p><strong>"Freddy Frugal, Caleb Cantroast and Kent Taekehent are all up there!"</strong> he laughs.</p><p>Well, no matter what character he plays next, one thing we know for sure is that Cameron Geller has a bright future ahead of him!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicsZucqsCqwsRmoKeslafDqrHWZpqapZWnvK95xp6jpZ2iYsawwdOumZ5lkZjBqrrGZqurmZmjtq%2BzjKmjrqtdp7K3scClqmagmah6p63VqKmirJVisKmt0ZqarZ2iZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bobbi-althoff-daughter-real-name-sparks-debate-defends-choice.html><span>←</span><span>Bobbi Althoff Daughter Real Name Sparks Debate &amp;amp; Defends Choice</span></a>
